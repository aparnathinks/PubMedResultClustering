An attempt is made at clarifying the problem. Four children from two families have been observed. There were inter- and intrafamilial variabilities of the expression and severity of the particular features, but retinopathy and structural and/or functional abnormalities were found in 100%. The combination of the two can serve as an easy clinical screening for diagnosis of the disease. Renal involvement is considered to be a cardinal feature of the syndrome. The most common and earliest symptoms are polydypso-polyuria and reduced concentrating ability, which may lead to some diagnostic difficulties, especially in infancy. Three children have end-stage renal disease and two of them are on maintenance haemodialysis, which they tolerate well.\n8270381\t41\t62\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n8270381\t91\t94\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n8270381\t128\t135\tobesity\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n8270381\t137\t155\tmental retardation\tDisease\tMESH:D008607\n8270381\t157\t179\tpigmentary retinopathy\tDisease\tMESH:D012174\n8270381\t184\t196\thypogonadism\tDisease\tMESH:D007006\n8270381\t294\t316\tLaurence-Moon syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D007849\n8270381\t318\t321\tLMS\tDisease\tMESH:D007849\n8270381\t450\t458\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n8270381\t610\t621\tretinopathy\tDisease\tMESH:D012164\n8270381\t786\t803\tRenal involvement\tDisease\tMESH:D007674\n8270381\t902\t920\tpolydypso-polyuria\tDisease\tMESH:D011141\n8270381\t1033\t1041\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n8270381\t1047\t1070\tend-stage renal disease\tDisease\tMESH:D007676\n\n'b'8712208|t|Midodrine efficacy and pharmacokinetics in a patient with recurrent intradialytic hypotension.\n8712208|a|Recurrent intradialytic hypotension, a complication of hemodialysis, is a consequence of an inadequate compensatory response or a paradoxic response to ultrafiltration-induced volume reduction.

Genetic and mutational analyses have indicated that, in some families, a combination of three mutant alleles at two loci (triallelic inheritance) is necessary for pathogenesis. To date, four of the five known BBS loci have been implicated in this mode of oligogenic disease transmission. We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum, distribution, and involvement in non-Mendelian trait transmission of mutant alleles in BBS1, the most common BBS locus. Analyses of 259 independent families segregating a BBS phenotype indicate that BBS1 participates in complex inheritance and that, in different families, mutations in BBS1 can interact genetically with mutations at each of the other known BBS genes, as well as at unknown loci, to cause the phenotype. Consistent with this model, we identified homozygous M390R alleles, the most frequent BBS1 mutation, in asymptomatic individuals in two families. Moreover, our statistical analyses indicate that the prevalence of the M390R allele in the general population is consistent with an oligogenic rather than a recessive model of disease transmission. The distribution of BBS oligogenic alleles also indicates that all BBS loci might interact genetically with each other, but some genes, especially BBS2 and BBS6, are more likely to participate in triallelic inheritance, suggesting a variable ability of the BBS proteins to interact genetically with each other.\n12677556\t23\t27\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n12677556\t241\t245\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n12677556\t276\t280\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n12677556\t282\t286\tBBS2\tGene\t583\n12677556\t288\t292\tBBS4\tGene\t585\n12677556\t294\t298\tBBS6\tGene\t8195\n12677556\t304\t308\tBBS7\tGene\t55212\n12677556\t739\t743\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n12677556\t761\t764\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n12677556\t823\t826\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n12677556\t851\t855\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n12677556\t938\t942\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n12677556\t1126\t1131\tM390R\tProteinMutation\tp.M390R;RS#:113624356\n12677556\t1159\t1163\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n12677556\t1290\t1295\tM390R\tProteinMutation\tp.M390R;RS#:113624356\n12677556\t1564\t1568\tBBS2\tGene\t583\n12677556\t1573\t1577\tBBS6\tGene\t8195\n\n'b'15077107|t|Increased airway epithelial Na+ absorption produces cystic fibrosis-like lung disease in mice.\n15077107|a|Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene result in defective epithelial cAMP-dependent Cl(-) secretion and increased airway Na(+) absorption. The mechanistic links between these altered ion transport processes and the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, however, are unclear. To test the hypothesis that accelerated Na(+) transport alone can produce cystic fibrosis-like lung disease, we generated mice with airway-specific overexpression of epithelial Na(+) channels (ENaC). Here we show that increased airway Na(+) absorption in vivo caused airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion, increased mucus concentration, delayed mucus transport and mucus adhesion to airway surfaces. Defective mucus transport caused a severe spontaneous lung disease sharing features with cystic fibrosis, including mucus obstruction, goblet cell metaplasia, neutrophilic inflammation and poor bacterial clearance. We conclude that increasing airway Na(+) absorption initiates cystic fibrosis-like lung disease and produces a model for the study of the pathogenesis and therapy of this disease.\n15077107\t59\t85\tfibrosis-like lung disease\tDisease\tMESH:D005355\n15077107\t89\t93\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n15077107\t112\t163\tcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\tGene\t12638\n15077107\t165\t169\tCFTR\tGene\t12638\n15077107\t207\t211\tcAMP\tChemical\tMESH:D000242\n15077107\t369\t397\tcystic fibrosis lung disease\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n15077107\t495\t528\tcystic fibrosis-like lung disease\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n15077107\t543\t547\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n15077107\t587\t612\tepithelial Na(+) channels\tGene\t20276\n15077107\t614\t618\tENaC\tGene\t20276\n15077107\t882\t894\tlung disease\tDisease\tMESH:D008171\n15077107\t917\t932\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n15077107\t950\t961\tobstruction\tDisease\tMESH:D007415\n15077107\t987\t1012\tneutrophilic inflammation\tDisease\tMESH:D007249\n15077107\t1022\t1031\tbacterial\tSpecies\t2\n15077107\t1112\t1138\tfibrosis-like lung disease\tDisease\tMESH:D005355\n\n'b'15110498|t|Osteogenesis imperfecta.\n15110498|a|Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder of increased bone fragility, low bone mass, and other connective-tissue manifestations.

C. elegans BBS proteins localize predominantly at the base of cilia, and like proteins involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process necessary for cilia biogenesis and maintenance, move bidirectionally along the ciliary axoneme. Importantly, we demonstrate that BBS-7 and BBS-8 are required for the normal localization/motility of the IFT proteins OSM-5/Polaris and CHE-11, and to a notably lesser extent, CHE-2. We propose that BBS proteins play important, selective roles in the assembly and/or function of IFT particle components.

In European folklore, the curse that "a child that taste salty when kissed will soon die" (Alonso y de los Ruyzes de Fonteca J. Diez Previlegios para Mugeres Prenadas. Henares, Spain, 1606) has been taken by many as a direct reference to cystic fibrosis [Busch R. Acta Univ Carol Med (Praha) 36: 13-15, 1990]. The high salt concentration in sweat from patients with CF is now accepted as almost pathognomonic with this fatal genetic disease, but the earliest descriptions of cystic fibrosis as a disease entity did not mention sweat or sweat glands (Andersen DH. Am J Dis Child 56: 344-399, 1938; Andersen DH, Hodges RG. Am J Dis Child 72: 62-80, 1946). Nonetheless, defective sweating soon became an inseparable, and major, component of the constellation of symptoms that diagnose "cystic fibrosis" (Davis PB. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 173: 475-482, 2006). The sweat gland has played a foremost role in diagnosing, defining pathophysiology, debunking misconceptions, and increasing our understanding of the effects of the disease on organs, tissues, cells, and molecules.

However, despite the identification of 12 BBS genes, the molecular basis of BBS remains elusive. Here we identify a complex composed of seven highly conserved BBS proteins. This complex, the BBSome, localizes to nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm but also to the membrane of the cilium. Interestingly, the BBSome is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Strikingly, Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Conversely, preventing Rab8(GTP) production blocks ciliation in cells and yields characteristic BBS phenotypes in zebrafish.

In particular, kidney disease in BBS is clinically heterogeneous, but is now recognized as a cardinal feature and a major cause of mortality in BBS.\n21246219\t26\t47\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tGene\t583\n21246219\t73\t94\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tGene\t583\n21246219\t96\t99\tBBS\tGene\t583\n21246219\t106\t142\tmultisystemic developmental disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D056587\n21246219\t185\t192\tobesity\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n21246219\t194\t209\tretinal defects\tDisease\tMESH:D012173\n21246219\t224\t236\thypogonadism\tDisease\tMESH:D007006\n21246219\t238\t255\trenal dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D007674\n21246219\t261\t282\tlearning disabilities\tDisease\tMESH:D007859\n21246219\t334\t337\tBBS\tGene\t583\n21246219\t482\t501\tciliary dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D002925\n21246219\t524\t527\tBBS\tGene\t583\n21246219\t715\t729\tkidney disease\tDisease\tMESH:D007674\n21246219\t733\t736\tBBS\tGene\t583\n21246219\t844\t847\tBBS\tGene\t583\n\n'b'21603163|t|Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in asthma and cystic fibrosis.\n21603163|a|Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a Th2 hypersensitivity lung disease in response to Aspergillus fumigatus that affects asthmatic and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Sensitization to A. fumigatus is common in both atopic asthmatic and CF patients, yet only 1-2% of asthmatic and 7-9% of CF patients develop ABPA. ABPA is characterized by wheezing and pulmonary infiltrates which may lead to pulmonary fibrosis and/or bronchiectasis. The inflammatory response is characterized by Th2 responses to Aspergillus allergens, increased serum IgE and eosinophilia. A number of genetic risks have recently been identified in the development of ABPA. These include HLA-DR and HLA-DQ, IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4RA) polymorphisms, IL-10-1082GA promoter polymorphisms, surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2) polymorphisms, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) mutations. The studies indicate that ABPA patients are genetically at risk to develop skewed and heightened Th2 responses to A. fumigatus antigens. These genetic risk studies and their consequences of elevated biologic markers may aid in identifying asthmatic and CF patients who are at risk to the development of ABPA. Furthermore, these studies suggest that immune modulation with medications such as anti-IgE, anti-IL-4 and/or IL-13 monoclonal antibodies may be helpful in the treatment of ABPA.\n21603163\t0\t49\tAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in asthma\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t54\t69\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n21603163\t71\t110\tAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t112\t116\tABPA\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t127\t156\thypersensitivity lung disease\tDisease\tMESH:D008171\n21603163\t172\t193\tAspergillus fumigatus\tSpecies\t746128\n21603163\t221\t236\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n21603163\t238\t240\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n21603163\t242\t250\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n21603163\t269\t281\tA. fumigatus\tSpecies\t746128\n21603163\t321\t323\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n21603163\t324\t332\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n21603163\t373\t375\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n21603163\t376\t384\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n21603163\t393\t397\tABPA\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t399\t403\tABPA\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t477\t495\tpulmonary fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D011658\n21603163\t629\t641\teosinophilia\tDisease\tMESH:D004802\n21603163\t721\t725\tABPA\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t760\t785\tIL-4 receptor alpha chain\tGene\t3566\n21603163\t787\t793\tIL-4RA\tGene\t3566\n21603163\t810\t815\tIL-10\tGene\t3586\n21603163\t847\t868\tsurfactant protein A2\tGene\t729238\n21603163\t870\t875\tSP-A2\tGene\t729238\n21603163\t896\t947\tcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\tGene\t1080\n21603163\t954\t958\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n21603163\t997\t1001\tABPA\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t1002\t1010\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n21603163\t1224\t1226\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n21603163\t1227\t1235\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n21603163\t1274\t1278\tABPA\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n21603163\t1378\t1382\tIL-4\tGene\t3565\n21603163\t1390\t1395\tIL-13\tGene\t3596\n21603163\t1453\t1457\tABPA\tDisease\tMESH:D055732\n\n'b'21670757|t|New perspectives on osteogenesis imperfecta.\n21670757|a|A new paradigm has emerged for osteogenesis imperfecta as a collagen-related disorder. The more prevalent autosomal dominant forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are caused by primary defects in type I collagen, whereas autosomal recessive forms are caused by deficiency of proteins which interact with type I procollagen for post-translational modification and/or folding. Factors that contribute to the mechanism of dominant osteogenesis imperfecta include intracellular stress, disruption of interactions between collagen and noncollagenous proteins, compromised matrix structure, abnormal cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and tissue mineralization. Recessive osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by deficiency of any of the three components of the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Absence of 3-hydroxylation is associated with increased modification of the collagen helix, consistent with delayed collagen folding. Other causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta include deficiency of the collagen chaperones FKBP10 or Serpin H1. Murine models are crucial to uncovering the common pathways in dominant and recessive osteogenesis imperfecta bone dysplasia. Clinical management of osteogenesis imperfecta is multidisciplinary, encompassing substantial progress in physical rehabilitation and surgical procedures, management of hearing, dental and pulmonary abnormalities, as well as drugs, such as bisphosphonates and recombinant human growth hormone. Novel treatments using cell therapy or new drug regimens hold promise for the future.\n21670757\t20\t43\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t76\t99\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t179\t202\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t301\t323\tdeficiency of proteins\tDisease\tMESH:D058495\n21670757\t344\t362\ttype I procollagen\tGene\t1278\n21670757\t459\t491\tdominant osteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t710\t733\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t805\t811\tprolyl\tChemical\tMESH:C065612\n21670757\t987\t1039\trecessive osteogenesis imperfecta include deficiency\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t1067\t1073\tFKBP10\tGene\t60681\n21670757\t1077\t1086\tSerpin H1\tGene\t871\n21670757\t1088\t1094\tMurine\tSpecies\t10090\n21670757\t1164\t1212\trecessive osteogenesis imperfecta bone dysplasia\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t1237\t1260\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n21670757\t1403\t1426\tpulmonary abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D011655\n21670757\t1454\t1469\tbisphosphonates\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n21670757\t1486\t1491\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'22229570|t|New therapies in cystic fibrosis.\n22229570|a|Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that lead to abnormalities in transepithelial ion transport in the airways of affected patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: This review focuses on three main aspects of the recent advances in the field: understanding the lung disease pathophysiology (in particular, the early events that condition its onset), better definition of the complex microbiology of the CF airway, and therapeutic developments. Although the most recently developed therapies, whether approved or under study, do not constitute a definitive cure, the benefit to patients is already becoming clearly apparent.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins form a complex that is important for several cytoskeleton-related processes such as ciliogenesis, cell migration and division. However, the mechanisms by which BBS proteins may regulate the cytoskeleton remain unclear. We discovered that Bbs4- and Bbs6-deficient renal medullary cells display a characteristic behaviour comprising poor migration, adhesion and division with an inability to form lamellipodial and filopodial extensions. Moreover, fewer mutant cells were ciliated [48% \xc2\xb1 6 for wild-type (WT) cells versus 23% \xc2\xb1 7 for Bbs4 null cells; P < 0.0001] and their cilia were shorter (2.55 \xce\xbcm \xc2\xb1 0.41 for WT cells versus 2.16 \xce\xbcm \xc2\xb1 0.23 for Bbs4 null cells; P < 0.0001). While the microtubular cytoskeleton and cortical actin were intact, actin stress fibre formation was severely disrupted, forming abnormal apical stress fibre aggregates. Furthermore, we observed over-abundant focal adhesions (FAs) in Bbs4-, Bbs6- and Bbs8-deficient cells. In view of these findings and the role of RhoA in regulation of actin filament polymerization, we showed that RhoA-GTP levels were highly upregulated in the absence of Bbs proteins. Upon treatment of Bbs4-deficient cells with chemical inhibitors of RhoA, we were able to restore the cilia length and number as well as the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Together these findings indicate that Bbs proteins play a central role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and control the cilia length through alteration of RhoA levels.\n23716571\t100\t113\tPrimary cilia\tDisease\tMESH:C536287\n23716571\t470\t474\tBbs4\tGene\t585\n23716571\t480\t484\tBbs6\tGene\t8195\n23716571\t764\t768\tBbs4\tGene\t585\n23716571\t877\t881\tBbs4\tGene\t585\n23716571\t1133\t1136\tFAs\tChemical\tMESH:D053222\n23716571\t1141\t1145\tBbs4\tGene\t585\n23716571\t1148\t1152\tBbs6\tGene\t8195\n23716571\t1158\t1162\tBbs8\tGene\t123016\n23716571\t1222\t1226\tRhoA\tGene\t387\n23716571\t1290\t1294\tRhoA\tGene\t387\n23716571\t1380\t1384\tBbs4\tGene\t585\n23716571\t1429\t1433\tRhoA\tGene\t387\n23716571\t1705\t1709\tRhoA\tGene\t387\n\n'b'23734358|t|Cystic fibrosis.\n23734358|a|There are now more adult than paediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and their life expectancy continues to improve.

In the second part, we present an update on the various aspects that constitute this disease.\n23793209\t0\t17\tNeurofibromatosis\tDisease\tMESH:D017253\n23793209\t61\t78\tNeurofibromatosis\tDisease\tMESH:D017253\n23793209\t142\t157\tgenetic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n23793209\t177\t204\tneuroectodermal abnormality\tDisease\tMESH:D020752\n23793209\t487\t504\tneurofibromatosis\tGene\t4763\n\n'b'23817811|t|Quality of life among adult patients with neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2 and schwannomatosis: a systematic review of the literature.\n23817811|a|The aim of this study was to review the literature on quality of life among adult patients with neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2 and schwannomatosis, and to identify the specific aspects of quality of life that were studied and reported in this population. We also set out to report predictors of quality of life. Published research reports were included if they described quality of life in this population and met methodological quality according to a list of predefined criteria. Eight studies (7 in NF1, 1 in NF2, 0 in schwannomatosis), conducted between 2001 and 2013, met inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the eight studies was mostly high according to ratings by predefined criteria. Most studies reported that patients with NF experience decreased quality of life when compared to the general population. Visibility and disease severity were strong predictors of skin-specific quality of life in NF1 patients. However, the majority of findings regarding predictors of quality of life were weak or inconclusive. Given the decreased quality of life in NF patients, it is important to examine more comprehensively the psychosocial factors in this population, especially in patients with NF2 and schwannomatosis. Mind body interventions that address these domains may provide comprehensive and efficacious long term treatment.\n23817811\t28\t36\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23817811\t42\t61\tneurofibromatosis 1\tGene\t4763\n23817811\t63\t80\tneurofibromatosis\tDisease\tMESH:D017253\n23817811\t87\t102\tschwannomatosis\tDisease\tMESH:C536641\n23817811\t225\t233\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23817811\t239\t258\tneurofibromatosis 1\tGene\t4763\n23817811\t260\t279\tneurofibromatosis 2\tDisease\tMESH:D016518\n23817811\t284\t299\tschwannomatosis\tDisease\tMESH:C536641\n23817811\t654\t657\tNF1\tGene\t4763\n23817811\t664\t667\tNF2\tGene\t4771\n23817811\t674\t689\tschwannomatosis\tDisease\tMESH:C536641\n23817811\t885\t893\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23817811\t1071\t1074\tNF1\tGene\t4763\n23817811\t1075\t1083\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23817811\t1228\t1236\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23817811\t1345\t1353\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23817811\t1359\t1362\tNF2\tGene\t4771\n23817811\t1367\t1382\tschwannomatosis\tDisease\tMESH:C536641\n\n'b"23849732|t|The association between glomus tumors and neurofibromatosis.\n23849732|a|PURPOSE: To determine whether an epidemiologic association exists between glomus tumors and neurofibromatosis. METHODS: Using a pathology database, we established a study cohort consisting of all patients who had undergone excision of a glomus tumor of the hand between 1995 and 2010. We created a control cohort by randomly selecting 200 patients who had undergone excision of a ganglion cyst over the same period. We reviewed medical records for each cohort to identify patients with a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. We calculated the odds ratio was calculated and performed Fisher's exact test to determine the significance of the association. RESULTS: We identified 21 patients with glomus tumors of the hand. Six of these patients carried the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis (29%). In contrast, no patients in the control group carried the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. The odds ratio for a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis in association with a glomus tumor compared with controls was 168:1. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of a strong epidemiologic association between glomus tumors and neurofibromatosis. Glomus tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis in neurofibromatosis patients who present with a painful lesion of the hand or finger.

The clinical severity varies widely from being nearly asymptomatic with a mild predisposition to fractures, normal stature and normal lifespan being to profoundly disabling and even lethal. Extra skeletal manifestations may include blue-grey sclera and dental abnormalities. Initially, the classification of OI into four types was based on clinical findings, but more recently additional types OI (types V-XI) have been ascertained, based on the identification of different mutations. While this classification is somewhat controversial, it is described in this article. The treatment of patients with OI is based on the nature and severity of symptoms. The goal of therapy is to prevent fractures and disability, improve function and quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach is needed, and treatment options include medication such as bisphosphonates, surgery, and rehabilitation.

It is sometimes associated with other NF1 stigmata. Most patients have NF1 gene mutations. We describe a patient who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for spinal neurofibromatosis and belonged to a family in which other affected members exhibited classical NF1 stigmata. A novel missense (c.7109 T>A; p.Val2370Asp) mutation in exon 39 of the NF1 gene was present in the affected family members. The family displayed extreme phenotypic variability in the spectrum of NF1. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with spinal neurofibromatosis in the context of classical NF1 with an NF1 gene mutation. The term FSNF is inaccurate as this condition simply reflects the typical autosomal dominant pattern of NF1 inheritance with phenotypoc variability and does not encompass patients with sporadic disease or those in the context of a classical NF1 phenotype as reported in the present family.

We find that cells with ciliary NPY2R show augmented PYY3-36-dependent cAMP signaling.

By contrast, overexpression of hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion of both SMN2 and SMN1 pre-mRNA. Significantly, hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion in SMA patient cells. Thus, we conclude that hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion of both SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNA. We also demonstrate that hnRNP M contacts an enhancer on exon 7, which was previously shown to provide binding site for tra2\xce\xb2. We present evidence that hnRNP M and tra2\xce\xb2 contact overlapped sequence on exon 7 but with slightly different RNA sequence requirements. In addition, hnRNP M promotes U2AF65 recruitment on the flanking intron of exon 7. We conclude that hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion of SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNA through targeting an enhancer on exon 7 through recruiting U2AF65. Our results provide a clue that hnRNP M is a potential therapeutic target for SMA.\n24533984\t0\t7\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t40\t44\tSMN2\tGene\t6607\n24533984\t64\t80\tmuscular atrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D009133\n24533984\t117\t140\tSpinal muscular atrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24533984\t142\t145\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24533984\t153\t188\tautosomal recessive genetic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n24533984\t284\t287\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24533984\t319\t323\tSMN1\tGene\t6606\n24533984\t370\t373\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24533984\t374\t382\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24533984\t391\t395\tSMN2\tGene\t6607\n24533984\t417\t421\tSMN1\tGene\t6606\n24533984\t482\t486\tSMN2\tGene\t6607\n24533984\t513\t516\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24533984\t517\t525\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24533984\t545\t552\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t640\t644\tSMN2\tGene\t6607\n24533984\t649\t653\tSMN1\tGene\t6606\n24533984\t695\t702\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t737\t741\tSMN2\tGene\t6607\n24533984\t746\t750\tSMN1\tGene\t6606\n24533984\t776\t783\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t813\t816\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24533984\t817\t824\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n24533984\t855\t862\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t897\t901\tSMN1\tGene\t6606\n24533984\t906\t910\tSMN2\tGene\t6607\n24533984\t946\t953\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t1041\t1046\ttra2b\tGene\t6434\n24533984\t1073\t1080\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t1085\t1090\ttra2b\tGene\t6434\n24533984\t1197\t1204\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t1214\t1220\tU2AF65\tGene\t11338\n24533984\t1284\t1291\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t1321\t1325\tSMN1\tGene\t6606\n24533984\t1330\t1334\tSMN2\tGene\t6607\n24533984\t1403\t1409\tU2AF65\tGene\t11338\n24533984\t1443\t1450\thnRNP M\tGene\t4670\n24533984\t1489\t1492\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n\n'b'24611735|t|Genetic predictors of cardiovascular morbidity in Bardet-Biedl syndrome.\n24611735|a|Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare ciliopathy characterized by retinal dystrophy, obesity, intellectual disability, polydactyly, hypogonadism and renal impairment. Patients are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Mutations in BBS1 and BBS10 account for more than half of those with molecular confirmation of the diagnosis. To elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations with respect to cardiovascular risk indicators 50 patients with mutations in BBS1 were compared with 19 patients harbouring BBS10 mutations. All patients had truncating, missense or compound missense/truncating mutations. The effect of genotype and mutation type was analysed. C-reactive protein was higher in those with mutations in BBS10 and homozygous truncating mutations (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.013 and p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.002, respectively). Patients with mutations in BBS10 had higher levels of C peptide than those with mutations in BBS1 (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.043). Triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in patients with homozygous truncating mutations (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.048). Gamma glutamyl transferase was higher in patients with homozygous truncating mutations (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.007) and heterozygous missense and truncating mutations (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.002) than those with homozygous missense mutations. The results are compared with clinical cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with missense mutations in BBS1 have lower biochemical cardiovascular disease markers compared with patients with BBS10 and other BBS1 mutations. This could contribute to stratification of the clinical service.\n24611735\t50\t71\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n24611735\t133\t150\tretinal dystrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D058499\n24611735\t152\t159\tobesity\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n24611735\t161\t184\tintellectual disability\tDisease\tMESH:D008607\n24611735\t199\t232\thypogonadism and renal impairment\tDisease\tMESH:D007674\n24611735\t234\t242\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t263\t285\tcardiovascular disease\tDisease\tMESH:D002318\n24611735\t300\t304\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n24611735\t309\t314\tBBS10\tGene\t79738\n24611735\t492\t500\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t519\t523\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n24611735\t546\t554\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t566\t571\tBBS10\tGene\t79738\n24611735\t587\t595\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t719\t737\tC-reactive protein\tGene\t1401\n24611735\t776\t781\tBBS10\tGene\t79738\n24611735\t859\t867\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t886\t891\tBBS10\tGene\t79738\n24611735\t952\t956\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n24611735\t970\t982\tTriglyceride\tChemical\tMESH:D014280\n24611735\t1021\t1029\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t1086\t1094\tglutamyl\tChemical\tMESH:C097376\n24611735\t1121\t1129\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t1357\t1365\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t1393\t1397\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n24611735\t1421\t1443\tcardiovascular disease\tDisease\tMESH:D002318\n24611735\t1466\t1474\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24611735\t1480\t1485\tBBS10\tGene\t79738\n24611735\t1496\t1500\tBBS1\tGene\t582\n\n'b'24619745|t|Triple-negative breast carcinoma: current and emerging concepts.\n24619745|a|OBJECTIVES: Triple-negative breast cancer is regarded as an aggressive disease that affects a young patient population and for which effective targeted therapy is not yet available.

End-stage cystic fibrosis can be treated with lung transplantation and is the third most common reason for which the procedure is performed. Outcomes for cystic fibrosis are better than most other lung diseases, but remain limited (5-year survival 60%). For patients with advanced disease lung transplantation appears to improve survival. Outcomes for patients with Burkholderia cepacia remain poor, although they are better for patients with certain genomovars. Controversy exists about Mycobacterium abscessus infection and appropriateness for transplant. More information is also becoming available for comorbidities, including diabetes and pulmonary hypertension among others.

Many of the symptoms characterized in the human disease have been reproduced in animal models carrying deletions or knock-in mutations of genes causal for the disorder. Thinning of the cerebral cortex, enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles, and structural changes in cilia are among the pathologies documented in these animal models. Ciliopathy is of particular interest in light of recent studies that have implicated primary neuronal cilia (PNC) in neuronal signal transduction. In the present investigation, we tested the hypothesis that areas of the brain responsible for learning and memory formation would differentially exhibit PNC abnormalities in animals carrying a deletion of the Bbs4 gene (Bbs4-/-). Immunohistochemical localization of adenylyl cyclase-III (ACIII), a marker restricted to PNC, revealed dramatic alterations in PNC morphology and a statistically significant reduction in number of immunopositive cilia in the hippocampus and amygdala of Bbs4-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Western blot analysis confirmed the decrease of ACIII levels in the hippocampus and amygdala of Bbs4-/- mice, and electron microscopy demonstrated pathological alterations of PNC in the hippocampus and amygdala. Importantly, no neuronal loss was found within the subregions of amygdala and hippocampus sampled in Bbs4-/- mice and there were no statistically significant alterations of ACIII immunopositive cilia in other areas of the brain not known to contribute to the BBS phenotype. Considered with data documenting a role of cilia in signal transduction these findings support the conclusion that alterations in cilia structure or neurochemical phenotypes may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in the Bbs4-/- mouse mode.\n24695551\t81\t86\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n24695551\t117\t120\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n24695551\t153\t177\tinherited human disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n24695551\t255\t260\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n24695551\t642\t649\tprimary\tChemical\tMESH:C567652\n24695551\t650\t664\tneuronal cilia\tDisease\tMESH:D009410\n24695551\t858\t875\tPNC abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D009410\n24695551\t914\t918\tBbs4\tGene\t102774\n24695551\t925\t929\tBbs4\tGene\t102774\n24695551\t971\t991\tadenylyl cyclase-III\tGene\t104111\n24695551\t993\t998\tACIII\tGene\t104111\n24695551\t1188\t1192\tBbs4\tGene\t102774\n24695551\t1196\t1200\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n24695551\t1228\t1239\tlittermates\tSpecies\t10090\n24695551\t1289\t1294\tACIII\tGene\t104111\n24695551\t1337\t1341\tBbs4\tGene\t102774\n24695551\t1345\t1349\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n24695551\t1469\t1482\tneuronal loss\tDisease\tMESH:D009410\n24695551\t1554\t1558\tBbs4\tGene\t102774\n24695551\t1562\t1566\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n24695551\t1626\t1631\tACIII\tGene\t104111\n24695551\t1712\t1715\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n24695551\t1923\t1941\tcognitive deficits\tDisease\tMESH:D003072\n24695551\t1958\t1962\tBbs4\tGene\t102774\n24695551\t1966\t1971\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n\n'b'24705136|t|Zebrafish models of human motor neuron diseases: advantages and limitations.\n24705136|a|Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are an etiologically heterogeneous group of disorders of neurodegenerative origin, which result in degeneration of lower (LMNs) and/or upper motor neurons (UMNs). Neurodegenerative MNDs include pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which involves specific degeneration of UMNs, leading to progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. In contrast, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) involves the specific degeneration of LMNs, with symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset MND, is characterized by the degeneration of both UMNs and LMNs, leading to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and spasticity. A review of the comparative neuroanatomy of the human and zebrafish motor systems showed that, while the zebrafish was a homologous model for LMN disorders, such as SMA, it was only partially relevant in the case of UMN disorders, due to the absence of corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts in its central nervous system. Even considering the limitation of this model to fully reproduce the human UMN disorders, zebrafish offer an excellent alternative vertebrate model for the molecular and genetic dissection of MND mechanisms. Its advantages include the conservation of genome and physiological processes and applicable in vivo tools, including easy imaging, loss or gain of function methods, behavioral tests to examine changes in motor activity, and the ease of simultaneous chemical/drug testing on large numbers of animals. This facilitates the assessment of the environmental origin of MNDs, alone or in combination with genetic traits and putative modifier genes. Positive hits obtained by phenotype-based small-molecule screening using zebrafish may potentially be effective drugs for treatment of human MNDs.\n24705136\t0\t9\tZebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n24705136\t20\t25\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n24705136\t77\t98\tMotor neuron diseases\tDisease\tMESH:D016472\n24705136\t100\t104\tMNDs\tDisease\tMESH:D016472\n24705136\t269\t291\tNeurodegenerative MNDs\tDisease\tMESH:D019636\n24705136\t305\t334\thereditary spastic paraplegia\tDisease\tMESH:D015419\n24705136\t336\t339\tHSP\tDisease\tMESH:D015419\n24705136\t366\t386\tdegeneration of UMNs\tDisease\tMESH:D009410\n24705136\t411\t421\tspasticity\tDisease\tMESH:D009128\n24705136\t455\t478\tspinal muscular atrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24705136\t480\t483\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24705136\t546\t561\tmuscle weakness\tDisease\tMESH:D018908\n24705136\t566\t573\tatrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D001284\n24705136\t575\t604\tAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\tDisease\tMESH:D000690\n24705136\t606\t609\tALS\tDisease\tMESH:D000690\n24705136\t640\t643\tMND\tDisease\t\n24705136\t669\t694\tdegeneration of both UMNs\tDisease\tMESH:D009410\n24705136\t728\t743\tmuscle weakness\tDisease\tMESH:D018908\n24705136\t745\t752\tatrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D001284\n24705136\t758\t768\tspasticity\tDisease\tMESH:D009128\n24705136\t818\t823\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n24705136\t828\t837\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n24705136\t875\t884\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n24705136\t912\t925\tLMN disorders\tDisease\tMESH:D009358\n24705136\t935\t938\tSMA\tDisease\tMESH:D009134\n24705136\t986\t999\tUMN disorders\tDisease\tMESH:D009358\n24705136\t1160\t1165\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n24705136\t1166\t1179\tUMN disorders\tDisease\tMESH:D009358\n24705136\t1181\t1190\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n24705136\t1663\t1667\tMNDs\tDisease\tMESH:D016472\n24705136\t1815\t1824\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n24705136\t1877\t1882\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n24705136\t1883\t1887\tMNDs\tDisease\tMESH:D016472\n\n'b'24715171|t|Cystic fibrosis liver disease - from diagnosis to risk factors.\n24715171|a|Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent monogenic genetic disease, autosomal recessive transmitted, characterized by an impressive clinical polymorphism and appreciative fatal prospective. Liver disease is the second non-pulmonary cause of death in cystic fibrosis, which, with increasing life expectancy, became an important management problem. Predisposing factors like male gender, pancreatic insufficiency, meconium ileus and severe mutation are incriminated to influence the occurrence of cystic fibrosis associated liver disease (CFLD). Our study included 174 patients with CF, monitored in the National Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Timisoara, Romania. They were routinely followed-up by clinical assessment, liver biochemical tests, ultrasound examinations and other methods like transient elastography, biopsy, in selected cases. Sixty-six patients, with median age at diagnosis 4.33 years, diagnosed with CFLD, without significant gender gap.

Identification of the specific disorder can help optimize the management and treatment of the patient and inform genetic counseling for the family, and therefore input from clinical geneticists is critical at the earliest stages of medical management. Here we present 30 patients with hypotonia of unknown etiology referred by a neuropediatrician to clinical genetics. Clinical, genetic, and molecular evaluation of each patient was performed. Sixty-nine percent of the patients included in the study had a genetic disease, including eight with Prader-Willi syndrome, three with spinal muscular atrophy, one with Rett syndrome, and one with Sotos syndrome harboring a previously undescribed mutation.

At present, 17 genetic causes of OI and closely related disorders have been identified and it is expected that more will follow. Unlike most reviews that have been published in the last decade on the genetic causes and biochemical processes leading to OI, this review focuses on the clinical classification of OI and elaborates on the newly proposed OI classification from 2010, which returned to a descriptive and numerical grouping of five OI syndromic groups. The new OI nomenclature and the pre-and postnatal severity assessment introduced in this review, emphasize the importance of phenotyping in order to diagnose, classify, and assess severity of OI. This will provide patients and their families with insight into the probable course of the disorder and it will allow physicians to evaluate the effect of therapy. A careful clinical description in combination with knowledge of the specific molecular genetic cause is the starting point for development and assessment of therapy in patients with heritable disorders including OI. \xc2\xa9 2014 The Authors.

These processes are orchestrated through the dynamic association of mRNAs with RNA binding proteins and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Accurate formation of RNPs in vivo is fundamentally important to cellular development and function, and its impairment often leads to human disease. The survival motor neuron (SMN) protein is key to this biological paradigm: SMN is essential for the biogenesis of various RNPs that function in mRNA processing, and genetic mutations leading to SMN deficiency cause the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy. Here we review the expanding role of SMN in the regulation of gene expression through its multiple functions in RNP assembly. We discuss advances in our understanding of SMN activity as a chaperone of RNPs and how disruption of SMN-dependent RNA pathways can cause motor neuron disease.\n24769255\t642\t647\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n24769255\t852\t926\tSMN deficiency cause the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D019636\n\n'b'24915888|t|Cystic fibrosis related diabetes.\n24915888|a|Improved life expectancy in cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to an expanding population of adults with CF, now representing almost 50 % of the total CF population. This creates new challenges from long-term complications such as diabetes mellitus (DM), a condition that is present in 40 %-50 % of adults with CF. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) results from a primary defect of insulin deficiency and although sharing features with type 1 (DM1) and type 2 diabetes (DM2), it is a clinically distinct condition. Progression to diabetes is associated with poorer CF clinical outcomes and increased mortality. CFRD is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the prevalence of microvascular complications is lower than DM1 or DM2. Rather, the primary goal of insulin therapy is the preservation of lung function and optimization of nutritional status. There is increasing evidence that appropriate screening and early intervention with insulin can reverse weight loss and improve pulmonary function. This approach may include targeting postprandial hyperglycemia not detected by standard diagnostic tests such as the oral glucose tolerance test. Further clinical research is required to guide when and how much to intervene in patients who are already dealing with the burden of one chronic illness.\n24915888\t0\t15\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t24\t32\tdiabetes\tDisease\tMESH:D003920\n24915888\t62\t77\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t79\t81\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t133\t135\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t179\t181\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t259\t276\tdiabetes mellitus\tDisease\tMESH:D003920\n24915888\t278\t280\tDM\tDisease\tMESH:D003920\n24915888\t339\t341\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t343\t358\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t367\t375\tdiabetes\tDisease\tMESH:D003920\n24915888\t377\t381\tCFRD\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t406\t434\tdefect of insulin deficiency\tDisease\tMESH:C562709\n24915888\t478\t481\tDM1\tGene\t28509\n24915888\t487\t502\ttype 2 diabetes\tDisease\tMESH:D003924\n24915888\t504\t507\tDM2\tGene\t28508\n24915888\t564\t572\tdiabetes\tDisease\tMESH:D003920\n24915888\t599\t601\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t645\t649\tCFRD\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n24915888\t694\t716\tcardiovascular disease\tDisease\tMESH:D002318\n24915888\t781\t784\tDM1\tGene\t28509\n24915888\t788\t791\tDM2\tGene\t28508\n24915888\t821\t828\tinsulin\tGene\t3630\n24915888\t998\t1005\tinsulin\tGene\t3630\n24915888\t1018\t1029\tweight loss\tDisease\tMESH:D015431\n24915888\t1111\t1124\thyperglycemia\tDisease\tMESH:D006943\n24915888\t1184\t1191\tglucose\tChemical\tMESH:D005947\n24915888\t1289\t1297\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'24950034|t|Osteogenesis imperfecta types I-XI: implications for the neonatal nurse.\n24950034|a|Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also called "brittle bone disease," is a rare heterozygous connective tissue disorder that is caused by mutations of genes that affect collagen.

Somatic mutations giving rise to limited disease, such as segmental neurofibromatosis are manifestations of mosaicism. If the mutation occurs before tissue differentiation, the clinical phenotype will be generalized disease. Mutations that occur later in development give rise to disease that is confined to a single region.

METHODS: Patients were enrolled at 3 study sites and followed for up to 36 months with serial clinical, motor function, laboratory, and electrophysiologic outcome assessments. Intervention was determined by published standard of care guidelines. Palliative care options were offered. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 54 eligible subjects with SMA-I (63%) enrolled and 50% of these completed at least 12 months of follow-up. The median age at reaching the combined endpoint of death or requiring at least 16 hours/day of ventilation support was 13.5 months (interquartile range 8.1-22.0 months). Requirement for nutritional support preceded that for ventilation support. The distribution of age at reaching the combined endpoint was similar for subjects with SMA-I who had symptom onset before 3 months and after 3 months of age (p=0.58). Having 2 SMN2 copies was associated with greater morbidity and mortality than having 3 copies. Baseline electrophysiologic measures indicated substantial motor neuron loss. By comparison, subjects with SMA-II who lost sitting ability (n=10) had higher motor function, motor unit number estimate and compound motor action potential, longer survival, and later age when feeding or ventilation support was required. The mean rate of decline in The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disorders motor function scale was 1.27 points/year (95% confidence interval 0.21-2.33, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Infants with SMA-I can be effectively enrolled and retained in a 12-month natural history study until a majority reach the combined endpoint.

The gene expression profiles of TNBCs are similar to those of breast tumours in women with BRCA1 mutations. Reports to date indicate that up to 20\xc2\xa0% of TNBC patients harbour germline BRCA mutations; however, the prevalence of BRCA mutations in TNBC patients varies widely between countries and from study to study. We studied 774 women with triple-negative breast cancer, diagnosed on average at age 58.0\xc2\xa0years. Samples of genomic DNA were provided by the Australian Breast Cancer Tissue Bank (ABCTB) (439 patients) and by the Department of Genetics and Pathology of the Pomeranian Medical University (335 patients). The entire coding regions and the exon-intron boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were amplified and sequenced by next-generation sequencing. We identified a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in 74 of 774 (9.6\xc2\xa0%) triple-negative patients. The mutation prevalence was 9.3\xc2\xa0% in Australia and was 9.9\xc2\xa0% in Poland. In both countries, the mean age of diagnoses of BRCA1 mutation carriers was significantly lower than that of non-carriers, while the age of onset of BRCA2 mutation carriers was similar to that of non-carriers. In the Australian cohort, 59\xc2\xa0% of the mutation-positive patients did not have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and would not have qualified for genetic testing.

Although several criteria have been proposed for the definition of PEx, no consensus has yet been reached. Very often, many PEx cases go unreported. A standardized and validated definition is needed to reduce variability in clinical practice. The pathophysiology of recurrent episodes remains unclear, and both onset and risk are multifactorial. PEx leads to increased healthcare costs, impaired quality of life and a cycle in which PEx causes loss of lung function, which predisposes to further episodes. The number of episodes affects survival. Although early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are highly recommended, measures to prevent the emergence of new PEx are even more important. In particular, inhaled antibiotics administered under new treatment schedules could play a key role in preventing exacerbations and thus delay decline in lung function and reduce mortality. The primary objective is zero exacerbations.\n25692532\t41\t56\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25692532\t142\t169\thallmark of cystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25692532\t615\t636\tloss of lung function\tDisease\tMESH:D008171\n\n'b'25752562|t|Radiation therapy in the locoregional treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.\n25752562|a|This Review assesses the relevant data and controversies regarding the use of radiotherapy for, and locoregional management of, women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In view of the strong association between BRCA1 and TNBC, knowledge of baseline mutation status can be useful to guide locoregional treatment decisions. TNBC is not a contraindication for breast conservation therapy because data suggest increased locoregional recurrence risks (relative to luminal subtypes) with breast conservation therapy or mastectomy. Although a boost to the tumour bed should routinely be considered after whole breast radiation therapy, TNBC should not be the sole indication for post-mastectomy radiation, and accelerated delivery methods for TNBC should be offered on clinical trials. Preliminary data implying a relative radioresistance for TNBC do not imply radiation omission because radiation provides an absolute locoregional risk reduction. At present, the integration of subtypes in locoregional management decisions is still in its infancy. Until level 1 data supporting treatment decisions based on subtypes are available, standard locoregional management principles should be adhered to.\n25752562\t67\t80\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n25752562\t210\t215\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n25752562\t237\t250\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n25752562\t301\t306\tBRCA1\tGene\t672\n25752562\t639\t645\ttumour\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n\n'b"25888148|t|Recent advances in cystic fibrosis.\n25888148|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The field of cystic fibrosis (CF) continues to evolve at a fast pace thanks to novel observations that have enabled deeper understanding of the disease pathophysiology. Parallel groundbreaking developments in innovative therapies permit, for the first time, distinct disease modification. RECENT FINDINGS: This review highlights important discoveries in fluid homeostasis and mucus secretion in CF that further informs the pathophysiology of the airway disease that characterizes CF. In addition, current concepts and novel paradigms, such as 'theratypes' and 'CF transmembrane conductance regulator chaperome', which will be important for the continued development of disease modifying therapies, are reviewed. SUMMARY: The rate of progress in the field continues to accelerate with new knowledge informing the development of innovative therapies. This has already led to tangible substantial and unprecedented clinical benefit for selected subsets of the CF patient population. In the years ahead, further knowledge acquisition may motivate the extension of these benefits to the larger population of people with CF.\n25888148\t19\t34\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25888148\t68\t83\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25888148\t85\t87\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25888148\t450\t452\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25888148\t535\t537\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25888148\t616\t618\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25888148\t1012\t1014\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n25888148\t1015\t1022\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n25888148\t1158\t1164\tpeople\tSpecies\t9606\n25888148\t1170\t1172\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n\n"b'26002249|t|Prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: 10-years experience.\n26002249|a|PURPOSE: We present in this study our 10years experience in prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis performed in the Tunisian population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on family history, 40 Tunisian couples were selected for prenatal diagnosis. Fetal DNA was isolated from amniotic fluid collected by transabdominal amniocentesis or from chronic villi by transcervical chorionic villus sampling. The genetic analysis for cystic fibrosis mutations was performed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis and denaturing high-pressure liquid phase chromatography. We performed microsatellites analysis by capillary electrophoresis in order to verify the absence of maternal cell contamination. RESULTS: Thirteen fetuses were affected, 21 were heterozygous carriers and 15 were healthy with two normal alleles of CFTR gene. Ten couples opted for therapeutic abortion. The microsatellites genotyping showed the absence of contamination of the fetal DNA by maternal DNA in 93.75%.

Within a decade of the early descriptions, the autosomal recessive nature of this genetic disease had been clarified, and its clinical features had been expanded. Secondary nutritional deficiencies complicated the underlying condition: the first clear description of CF as "a new disease", which included a speculation about its genetic basis (because there were 2 pairs of sibs in the case series) was published as Vitamin A deficiency in children [2]. The diagnosis was most often made at autopsy. When it was suspected in life, the diagnostic tests used included duodenal intubation to obtain fluid which would show impaired tryptic digestion of the coating of X-Ray film in CF children, and measurement of vitamin A in the blood. Some nutritional improvement could be expected with simple, rather inefficient pancreatic enzyme preparations, but it was not until mid-century that antibiotics began to treat pulmonary infections effectively. As a young doctor in the 1950s I soon became aware that the median age at death for affected children was about one year, and most died before reaching school age. .\n26003065\t21\t36\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n26003065\t125\t140\tCystic Fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n26003065\t142\t144\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n26003065\t425\t449\tnutritional deficiencies\tDisease\tMESH:D044342\n26003065\t519\t521\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n26003065\t668\t677\tVitamin A\tChemical\tMESH:C059630\n26003065\t692\t700\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n26003065\t930\t932\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n26003065\t933\t941\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n26003065\t962\t971\tvitamin A\tChemical\tMESH:C059630\n26003065\t1162\t1182\tpulmonary infections\tDisease\tMESH:D011655\n26003065\t1289\t1297\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b"26031935|t|IFITM5 mutations and osteogenesis imperfecta.\n26031935|a|Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5) is an osteoblast-specific membrane protein that has been shown to be a positive regulatory factor for mineralization in vitro.

Previously, the disorder was thought to be an autosomal dominant bone dysplasia caused by defects in type I collagen, but in the past 10 years discoveries of novel (mainly recessive) causative genes have lent support to a predominantly collagen-related pathophysiology and have contributed to an improved understanding of normal bone development. Defects in proteins with very different functions, ranging from structural to enzymatic and from intracellular transport to chaperones, have been described in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. Knowledge of the specific molecular basis of each form of the disorder will advance clinical diagnosis and potentially stimulate targeted therapeutic approaches. In this Seminar, together with diagnosis, management, and treatment, we describe the defects causing osteogenesis imperfecta and their mechanism and interrelations, and classify them into five groups on the basis of the metabolic pathway compromised, specifically those related to collagen synthesis, structure, and processing; post-translational modification; folding and cross-linking; mineralisation; and osteoblast differentiation.\n26542481\t0\t23\tOsteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n26542481\t25\t48\tOsteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n26542481\t165\t187\tskeletal abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D009139\n26542481\t196\t224\tbone fragility and deformity\tDisease\tMESH:C536063\n26542481\t272\t305\tautosomal dominant bone dysplasia\tDisease\tMESH:D001848\n26542481\t732\t740\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26542481\t746\t769\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n26542481\t1034\t1057\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n\n'b'26568208|t|Circulating tumor DNA for triple-negative breast cancer diagnosis and treatment decisions.\n26568208|a|Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive disease characterized by a high number of relapses and poor overall survival.

Olfactory dysfunction is often overlooked in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) patients and is rarely objectively evaluated by MRI. We present a series of 20 BBS patients with olfactory dysfunction. The OB was evaluated separately and blindly by two radiologists (SR and SM) with 3 Tesla MRI imaging comparatively to 12 normal control subjects by global visual evaluation and by quantitative measurement of OB volume. In the 12 control cases OB visual evaluation was considered as normal in all cases for radiologist (SR) and in 10 cases for radiologist (SM). In the 20 BBS patients, OB visual evaluation was considered as abnormal in 18 cases for SR and in all cases for SM. OB volumetric evaluation for SR and SM in BBS patients was able to provide significant correlation between BBS and olfactory dysfunction. This study indicates that OB volume evaluation by MRI imaging like structural MRI scan for gray matter modifications demonstrates that olfactory dysfunction in BBS patients is a constant and cardinal symptom integrated in a genetical syndrome with peripheral and central olfactory structure alterations.\n26586152\t60\t81\tolfactory dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D020431\n26586152\t85\t106\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n26586152\t124\t126\tOB\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n26586152\t221\t242\tolfactory dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D020431\n26586152\t271\t292\tOlfactory dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D020431\n26586152\t316\t337\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n26586152\t339\t342\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n26586152\t344\t352\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26586152\t423\t426\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n26586152\t427\t435\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26586152\t441\t462\tolfactory dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D020431\n26586152\t468\t470\tOB\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n26586152\t672\t674\tOB\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n26586152\t707\t716\tOB visual\tDisease\tMESH:D014786\n26586152\t835\t838\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n26586152\t839\t847\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26586152\t849\t858\tOB visual\tDisease\tMESH:D014786\n26586152\t941\t943\tOB\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n26586152\t983\t986\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n26586152\t987\t995\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26586152\t1048\t1051\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n26586152\t1056\t1077\tolfactory dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D020431\n26586152\t1105\t1107\tOB\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n26586152\t1214\t1235\tolfactory dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D020431\n26586152\t1239\t1242\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D049932\n26586152\t1243\t1251\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b"26790364|t|Cystic fibrosis from the gastroenterologist's perspective.\n26790364|a|Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting, recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

Manifestations are either a direct consequence of the primary defect in cystic fibrosis or a secondary complication of the disease or therapy. Adult patients with cystic fibrosis also have an increased risk of malignancy in the gastrointestinal and pancreatico-biliary tracts compared with the general population.

This study was retrospectively performed on 101 patients with stage II and III invasive breast cancer who received 6-8 cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Out of the total, 23 were in the triple negative breast cancer subgroup. Nuclear Ki-67 expression in both the large cohort group (n=101) and triple negative breast cancer subgroup (n=23) and its relation to the pathological response were evaluated. The purpose of the study was to identify the predictive value of nuclear protein Ki-67 expression among patients with invasive breast cancers, involving the triple negative breast cancer subgroup, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in correlation to the rate of pathological complete response. The proliferation marker Ki-67 expression was highest in the triple negative breast cancer subgroup. No appreciable difference in the rate of Ki-67 expression in triple negative breast cancer subgroup using either a cutoff of 14% or 35%. Triple negative breast cancer subgroup showed lower rates of pathological complete response. Achievement of pathological complete response was significantly correlated with smaller tumor size and higher Ki-67 expression. The majority of triple negative breast cancer cases achieved pathological partial response.

Similarities between mammary embryonic development and cell transformation suggest that the underlying processes required for mammary gland development are also those perturbed during various stages of mammary tumorigenesis and breast cancer (BC) development. The master regulators of embryonic development Cripto-1, Notch/CSL, and Wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin play key roles in modulating mammary gland morphogenesis and cell fate specification in the embryo through fetal mammary stem cells (fMaSC) and in the adult organism particularly within the adult mammary stem cells (aMaSC), which determine mammary progenitor cell lineages that generate the basal/myoepithelial and luminal compartments of the adult mammary gland. Together with recognized transcription factors and embryonic stem cell markers, these embryonic regulatory molecules can be inappropriately augmented during tumorigenesis to support the tumor-initiating cell (TIC)/cancer stem cell (CSC) compartment, and the effects of their deregulation may contribute for the etiology of BC, in particular the most aggressive subtype of BC, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This in depth review will present evidence of the involvement of Cripto-1, Notch/CSL, and Wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin in the normal mammary gland morphogenesis and tumorigenesis, from fMaSC/aMaSC regulation to TIC generation and maintenance in TNBC.

Integrating the available information provides both a better understanding of the effect of current approaches to treatment-largely improved architecture and possibly some macroscale toughening-and indicates potential opportunities for alternative strategies that can influence fracture resistance at longer-length scales.\n26987995\t28\t51\tOsteogenesis Imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n26987995\t53\t85\tOsteogenesis imperfecta entrains\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n26987995\t501\t524\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n26987995\t745\t753\tfracture\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n\n'b'27015557|t|Androgen deprivation therapy sensitizes triple negative breast cancer cells to immune-mediated lysis through androgen receptor independent modulation of osteoprotegerin.\n27015557|a|Among breast cancer types, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the fewest treatment options and the lowest 5-year survival rate. Androgen receptor (AR) inhibition has displayed efficacy against breast cancer preclinically and is currently being examined clinically in AR positive TNBC patients. Androgen deprivation has been shown to induce immunogenic modulation; the alteration of tumor cell phenotype resulting in increased sensitivity to immune-mediated killing. We evaluated the ability of AR inhibition to reduce the growth and improve the immune-mediated killing of breast cancer cells with differing expression of the estrogen receptor and AR. While AR expression was required for the growth inhibitory effects of enzalutamide on breast cancer cells, both enzalutamide and abiraterone improved the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to immune-mediated lysis independent of detectable AR expression. This increase in sensitivity was linked to an increase in cell surface tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor expression as well as a significant reduction in the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG). The reduction in OPG was further examined and found to be critical for the increase in sensitivity of AR- TNBC cells to immune-mediated killing. The data presented herein further support the use of AR inhibition therapy in the AR+ TNBC setting. These data, however, also support the consideration of AR inhibition therapy for the treatment of AR- TNBC, especially in combination with cancer immunotherapy, providing a potential novel therapeutic option for select patients.\n27015557\t0\t8\tAndrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D000728\n27015557\t56\t69\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27015557\t109\t126\tandrogen receptor\tGene\t367\n27015557\t153\t168\tosteoprotegerin\tGene\t4982\n27015557\t176\t189\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27015557\t213\t226\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27015557\t304\t321\tAndrogen receptor\tGene\t367\n27015557\t323\t325\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t369\t382\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27015557\t443\t445\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t460\t468\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27015557\t470\t478\tAndrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D000728\n27015557\t558\t563\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27015557\t670\t672\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t748\t761\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27015557\t801\t809\testrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n27015557\t823\t825\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t833\t835\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t897\t909\tenzalutamide\tChemical\tMESH:C540278\n27015557\t913\t926\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27015557\t939\t951\tenzalutamide\tChemical\tMESH:C540278\n27015557\t956\t967\tabiraterone\tChemical\tMESH:C089740\n27015557\t996\t1009\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27015557\t1067\t1069\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t1153\t1167\ttumor necrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D009336\n27015557\t1293\t1308\tosteoprotegerin\tGene\t4982\n27015557\t1310\t1313\tOPG\tGene\t4982\n27015557\t1333\t1336\tOPG\tGene\t4982\n27015557\t1418\t1420\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t1514\t1516\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t1543\t1545\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t1616\t1618\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t1659\t1661\tAR\tGene\t367\n27015557\t1700\t1706\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27015557\t1780\t1788\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'27074261|t|Highlights from the 2015 North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference.\n27074261|a|The 29th Annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference was held in Phoenix, Arizona on October 8-10, 2015.

Although the disease is most symptomatic in childhood, adults with osteogenesis imperfecta also are affected by the sequelae of the disease. Orthopaedic manifestations include posttraumatic and accelerated degenerative joint disease, kyphoscoliosis, and spondylolisthesis. Other manifestations of abnormal collagen include brittle dentition, hearing loss, cardiac valve abnormalities, and basilar invagination. In general, nonsurgical treatment is preferred for management of acute fractures. High rates of malunion, nonunion, and subsequent deformity have been reported with both closed and open treatment. When surgery is necessary, surgeons should opt for load-sharing intramedullary devices that span the entire length of the bone; locking plates and excessively rigid fixation generally should be avoided. Arthroplasty may be considered for active patients, but the procedure frequently is associated with complications in this patient population. Underlying deformities, such as malunion, bowing, rotational malalignment, coxa vara, and acetabular protrusio, pose specific surgical challenges and underscore the importance of preoperative planning.\n27100300\t46\t69\tOsteogenesis Imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n27100300\t71\t94\tOsteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n27100300\t172\t178\tpeople\tSpecies\t9606\n27100300\t268\t291\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n27100300\t377\t390\tposttraumatic\tDisease\tMESH:D013313\n27100300\t407\t433\tdegenerative joint disease\tDisease\tMESH:D019636\n27100300\t435\t449\tkyphoscoliosis\tDisease\tMESH:C565711\n27100300\t543\t555\thearing loss\tDisease\tMESH:D034381\n27100300\t557\t584\tcardiac valve abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D006349\n27100300\t683\t692\tfractures\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n27100300\t743\t752\tdeformity\tDisease\tMESH:D009140\n27100300\t1054\t1062\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27100300\t1134\t1141\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n27100300\t1165\t1176\tdeformities\tDisease\tMESH:D009140\n27100300\t1204\t1227\trotational malalignment\tDisease\tMESH:D017760\n\n'b'27140670|t|Cystic fibrosis.\n27140670|a|Cystic fibrosis is a common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder, with highest prevalence in Europe, North America, and Australia. The disease is caused by mutation of a gene that encodes a chloride-conducting transmembrane channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which regulates anion transport and mucociliary clearance in the airways. Functional failure of CFTR results in mucus retention and chronic infection and subsequently in local airway inflammation that is harmful to the lungs. CFTR dysfunction mainly affects epithelial cells, although there is evidence of a role in immune cells. Cystic fibrosis affects several body systems, and morbidity and mortality is mostly caused by bronchiectasis, small airways obstruction, and progressive respiratory impairment. Important comorbidities caused by epithelial cell dysfunction occur in the pancreas (malabsorption), liver (biliary cirrhosis), sweat glands (heat shock), and vas deferens (infertility). The development and delivery of drugs that improve the clearance of mucus from the lungs and treat the consequent infection, in combination with correction of pancreatic insufficiency and undernutrition by multidisciplinary teams, have resulted in remarkable improvements in quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis, with median life expectancy now older than 40 years. Innovative and transformational therapies that target the basic defect in cystic fibrosis have recently been developed and are effective in improving lung function and reducing pulmonary exacerbations. Further small molecule and gene-based therapies are being developed to restore CFTR function; these therapies promise to be disease modifying and to improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis.\n27140670\t0\t15\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27140670\t17\t32\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27140670\t59\t95\tautosomal recessive genetic disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n27140670\t221\t229\tchloride\tChemical\tMESH:D002712\n27140670\t274\t325\tcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\tGene\t1080\n27140670\t327\t331\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27140670\t430\t434\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27140670\t452\t483\tretention and chronic infection\tDisease\tMESH:D016055\n27140670\t517\t529\tinflammation\tDisease\tMESH:D007249\n27140670\t560\t564\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27140670\t664\t679\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27140670\t758\t772\tbronchiectasis\tDisease\tMESH:D001987\n27140670\t780\t799\tairways obstruction\tDisease\tMESH:D000402\n27140670\t817\t839\trespiratory impairment\tDisease\tMESH:D012131\n27140670\t916\t981\tpancreas (malabsorption), liver (biliary cirrhosis), sweat glands\tDisease\tMESH:D008105\n27140670\t1014\t1025\tinfertility\tDisease\tMESH:D007246\n27140670\t1142\t1151\tinfection\tDisease\tMESH:D007239\n27140670\t1187\t1211\tpancreatic insufficiency\tDisease\tMESH:D010188\n27140670\t1344\t1352\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27140670\t1358\t1373\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27140670\t1502\t1517\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27140670\t1709\t1713\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27140670\t1800\t1806\tpeople\tSpecies\t9606\n27140670\t1812\t1827\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n\n'b'27146508|t|Dental treatment for people with cystic fibrosis.\n27146508|a|AIM: To describe the nature and consequences of the multi-system genetic condition cystic fibrosis with a view to ensuring optimal dental treatment planning for these patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify the key medical and dental manifestations of cystic fibrosis. These findings are discussed and utilised to create recommendations for treatment planning in patients with cystic fibrosis for the practising dental practitioner. RESULTS: Cystic fibrosis is a complex, lethal, multisystem autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations on chromosome 7 which result in dysfunction of an ion channel that sits on epithelial surfaces. Respiratory disease remains the leading cause of mortality. Survival has greatly increased in recent decades secondary to improved treatment and specialist care. Specific dental manifestations of the disease may result from the condition itself or complications of treatment. Modification of patient management may be necessary to provide optimum patient care. CONCLUSION: The pathophysiology and clinical manifestations are relevant to practicing dental practitioners and inform recommendations to be utilised to ensure optimal treatment planning for these patients.\n27146508\t21\t27\tpeople\tSpecies\t9606\n27146508\t33\t48\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27146508\t102\t148\tmulti-system genetic condition cystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27146508\t217\t225\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27146508\t327\t342\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27146508\t438\t446\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27146508\t452\t467\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27146508\t517\t532\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27146508\t555\t595\tmultisystem autosomal recessive disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n27146508\t717\t736\tRespiratory disease\tDisease\tMESH:D012131\n27146508\t1009\t1016\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n27146508\t1064\t1071\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n27146508\t1275\t1283\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'27346233|t|Osteogenesis imperfecta: from diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment to future perspectives.\n27346233|a|Osteogenesis imperfecta is an inherited connective tissue disorder with wide phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity. A common issue associated with the molecular abnormality is a disturbance in bone matrix synthesis and homeostasis inducing bone fragility. In very early life, this can lead to multiple fractures and progressive bone deformities, including long bone bowing and scoliosis. Multidisciplinary management improves quality of life for patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. It consists of physical therapy, medical treatment and orthopaedic surgery as necessary. Medical treatment consists of bone-remodelling drug therapy. Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of moderate to severe osteogenesis imperfecta, from infancy to adulthood. Other more recent drug therapies include teriparatide and denosumab. All these therapies target the symptoms and have effects on the mechanical properties of bone due to modification of bone remodelling, therefore influencing skeletal outcome and orthopaedic surgery. Innovative therapies, such as progenitor and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, targeting the specific altered pathway rather than the symptoms, are in the process of development.\n27346233\t0\t23\tOsteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n27346233\t96\t119\tOsteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n27346233\t399\t408\tfractures\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n27346233\t425\t441\tbone deformities\tDisease\tMESH:D001847\n27346233\t474\t483\tscoliosis\tDisease\tMESH:D012600\n27346233\t543\t551\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27346233\t557\t580\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n27346233\t732\t747\tBisphosphonates\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n27346233\t803\t826\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n27346233\t1041\t1057\tbone remodelling\tDisease\tMESH:D001847\n\n'b'27442694|t|Polydactyly and obesity - the clinical manifestation of ciliopathy: a boy with Bardet-Biedl syndrome.\n27442694|a|The prevalence of obesity in children is still rising all over the world. The most common reason for significant weight gain is a high-calorie diet and decreased physical activity. However, apart from environmental factors, genetic predisposition plays a crucial role in the pathomechanism of obesity. We present the case of a boy with pathological obesity and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). BBS is a ciliopathy, a heterogeneous group of rare disorders associated with defects in primary cilia. Other clinical signs and symptoms of BBS are: polydactyly, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, intellectual disability, rod-cone dystrophy, genitourinary and renal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: genetic factors of rapid weight gain should be taken into consideration in a child with obesity. Polydactyly can be associated with ciliopathy.

The present study describes renal findings in 41 BBS patients and analyzes the pathogenesis of hyposthenuria, the most common renal dysfunction. Five of 41 patients (12%) showed an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml\xc2\xb7min(-1)\xc2\xb71.73 m(-2) Urine protein and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio were over 200 and 30 mg/g in 9/24 and 7/23 patients, respectively. Four of 41 patients showed no renal anomalies on ultrasound. Twenty of 34 patients had hyposthenuria in the absence of renal insufficiency. In all 8 of the hyposthenuric patients studied, dDAVP failed to elevate urine osmolality (Uosm), suggesting a nephrogenic origin. Interestingly, water loading (WL) did not result in a significant reduction of Uosm, indicating combined concentrating and diluting defects. dDAVP infusion induced a significant increase of plasma Factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor levels, supporting normal function of the type 2 vasopressin receptor at least in endothelial cells. While urinary aquaporin 2 (u-AQP2) abundance was not different between patients and controls at baseline, the dDAVP-induced increased u-AQP2 and the WL-induced reduction of u-AQP2 were blunted in patients with a combined concentrating and diluting defect, suggesting a potential role of AQP2 in the defective regulation of water absorption. Urine Uromodulin excretion was reduced in all hyposthenuric patients, suggesting a thick ascending limb defect. Interestingly, renal Na, Cl, Ca, but not K handling was impaired after acute WL but not at basal. In summary, BBS patients show combined urinary concentration and dilution defects; a thick ascending limb and collecting duct tubulopathy may underlie impaired water handling.\n27488999\t19\t40\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n27488999\t135\t139\tAQP2\tGene\t359\n27488999\t144\t148\tUMOD\tGene\t7369\n27488999\t183\t204\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n27488999\t206\t209\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n27488999\t280\t283\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n27488999\t284\t292\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t326\t339\thyposthenuria\tDisease\t\n27488999\t357\t374\trenal dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D007674\n27488999\t387\t395\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t511\t521\tcreatinine\tChemical\tMESH:D003404\n27488999\t571\t579\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t606\t614\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t625\t640\trenal anomalies\tDisease\tMESH:D007674\n27488999\t669\t677\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t682\t733\thyposthenuria in the absence of renal insufficiency\tDisease\tMESH:D051437\n27488999\t751\t764\thyposthenuric\tDisease\t\n27488999\t765\t773\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t1078\t1092\tvon Willebrand\tDisease\tMESH:D014842\n27488999\t1230\t1234\tAQP2\tGene\t359\n27488999\t1272\t1280\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t1337\t1341\tAQP2\tGene\t359\n27488999\t1376\t1380\tAQP2\tGene\t359\n27488999\t1397\t1405\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t1440\t1455\tdiluting defect\tDisease\tMESH:C566872\n27488999\t1488\t1492\tAQP2\tGene\t359\n27488999\t1588\t1601\thyposthenuric\tDisease\t\n27488999\t1602\t1610\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t1641\t1652\tlimb defect\tDisease\tMESH:C537754\n27488999\t1764\t1767\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n27488999\t1768\t1776\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27488999\t1817\t1833\tdilution defects\tDisease\tMESH:C566872\n27488999\t1873\t1889\tduct tubulopathy\tDisease\tMESH:D002292\n27488999\t1903\t1926\timpaired water handling\tDisease\tMESH:C562385\n\n'b'27578468|t|Heart involvement in cystic fibrosis: A specific cystic fibrosis-related myocardial changes?\n27578468|a|Cystic fibrosis is a complex multi-systemic chronic disease characterized by progressive organ dysfunction with development of fibrosis, possibly affecting the heart. Over the last four decades pathological, experimental, and clinical evidence points towards the existence of a specific myocardial involvement in cystic fibrosis. Multi-modality cardiac imaging, especially recent echocardiographic techniques, evidenced diastolic and/or systolic ventricular dysfunction in cystic fibrosis leading to the concept of a cystic fibrosis-related cardiomyopathy. Hypoxemia and inflammation are among the most important factors for heart involvement in cystic fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator was found to be involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contraction and may also account for cystic fibrosis-related myocardial dysfunction. This review, mainly focused on echocardiographic studies, seeks to synthesize the existing literature for and against the existence of heart involvement in cystic fibrosis, its mechanisms and prognostic implications. Careful investigation of the heart function may be helpful for risk stratification and therapeutic decisions in patients with cystic fibrosis.\n27578468\t21\t36\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t49\t64\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t93\t108\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t122\t152\tmulti-systemic chronic disease\tDisease\tMESH:C564969\n27578468\t182\t199\torgan dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D009102\n27578468\t220\t228\tfibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D005355\n27578468\t380\t402\tmyocardial involvement\tDisease\tMESH:D009202\n27578468\t406\t421\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t539\t562\tventricular dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D018754\n27578468\t566\t581\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t617\t625\tfibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D005355\n27578468\t634\t648\tcardiomyopathy\tDisease\tMESH:D009202\n27578468\t650\t659\tHypoxemia\tDisease\tMESH:D000860\n27578468\t664\t676\tinflammation\tDisease\tMESH:D007249\n27578468\t718\t735\theart involvement\tDisease\tMESH:D006331\n27578468\t739\t754\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t756\t771\tCystic Fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t893\t908\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t917\t939\tmyocardial dysfunction\tDisease\tMESH:D009202\n27578468\t1076\t1112\theart involvement in cystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27578468\t1270\t1278\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27578468\t1284\t1299\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n\n'b'27580659|t|Brachyury, a vaccine target, is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer.\n27580659|a|Patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a high rate of tumor metastasis and a poor prognosis. The treatment option for these patients is currently chemotherapy, which results in very low response rates. Strategies that exploit the immune system for the treatment of cancer have now shown the ability to improve survival in several tumor types. Identifying potential targets for immune therapeutic interventions is an important step in developing novel treatments for TNBC. In this study, in silico analysis of publicly available datasets and immunohistochemical analysis of primary and metastatic tumor biopsies from TNBC patients were conducted to evaluate the expression of the transcription factor brachyury, which is a driver of tumor metastasis and resistance and a target for cancer vaccine approaches. Analysis of breast cancer datasets demonstrated a predominant expression of brachyury mRNA in TNBC and in basal vs luminal or HER2 molecular breast cancer subtypes. At the protein level, variable levels of brachyury expression were detected both in primary and metastatic TNBC lesions. A strong association was observed between nuclear brachyury protein expression and the stage of disease, with nuclear brachyury being more predominant in metastatic vs primary tumors. Survival analysis also demonstrated an association between high levels of brachyury in the primary tumor and poor prognosis. Two brachyury-targeting cancer vaccines are currently undergoing clinical evaluation; the data presented here provide rationale for using brachyury-targeting immunotherapy approaches for the treatment of TNBC.\n27580659\t65\t78\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27580659\t80\t88\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27580659\t120\t133\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27580659\t161\t177\ttumor metastasis\tDisease\tMESH:D009362\n27580659\t231\t239\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27580659\t372\t378\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27580659\t437\t442\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27580659\t703\t708\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27580659\t728\t736\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27580659\t807\t816\tbrachyury\tGene\t6899\n27580659\t839\t855\ttumor metastasis\tDisease\tMESH:D009362\n27580659\t888\t894\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27580659\t927\t940\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27580659\t991\t1000\tbrachyury\tGene\t6899\n27580659\t1041\t1045\tHER2\tGene\t2064\n27580659\t1056\t1069\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27580659\t1121\t1130\tbrachyury\tGene\t6899\n27580659\t1187\t1199\tTNBC lesions\tDisease\tMESH:D051437\n27580659\t1243\t1260\tnuclear brachyury\tDisease\tMESH:C564596\n27580659\t1311\t1328\tnuclear brachyury\tDisease\tMESH:C564596\n27580659\t1377\t1383\ttumors\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27580659\t1459\t1468\tbrachyury\tGene\t6899\n27580659\t1484\t1489\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27580659\t1514\t1540\tbrachyury-targeting cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27580659\t1648\t1657\tbrachyury\tGene\t6899\n\n'b'27685428|t|Update of literature from cystic fibrosis registries 2012-2015.

Airways, pancreas, male genital system, intestine, liver, bone, and kidney are involved. The lack of CFTR or its impaired function causes fat malabsorption and chronic pulmonary infections leading to bronchiectasis and progressive lung damage. Previously considered lethal in infancy and childhood, CF has now attained median survivals of 50\xc2\xa0years of age, mainly thanks to the early diagnosis through neonatal screening, recognition of mild forms, and an aggressive therapeutic attitude. Classical treatment includes pancreatic enzyme replacement, respiratory physiotherapy, mucolitics, and aggressive antibiotic therapy. A significant proportion of patients with severe symptoms still requires lung or, less frequently, liver transplantation. The great number of mutations and their diverse effects on the CFTR protein account only partially for CF clinical variability, and modifier genes have a role in modulating the clinical expression of the disease. Despite the increasing understanding of CFTR functioning, several aspects of CF need still to be clarified, e.g., the worse outcome in females, the risk of malignancies, the pathophysiology, and best treatment of comorbidities, such as CF-related diabetes or CF-related bone disorder. Research is focusing on new drugs restoring CFTR function, some already available and with good clinical impact, others showing promising preliminary results that need to be confirmed in phase III clinical trials.\n27709245\t0\t15\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t34\t49\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t51\t53\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t103\t107\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27709245\t205\t209\tmale\tSpecies\t9606\n27709245\t287\t291\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27709245\t328\t341\tmalabsorption\tDisease\tMESH:D008286\n27709245\t354\t374\tpulmonary infections\tDisease\tMESH:D011655\n27709245\t386\t428\tbronchiectasis and progressive lung damage\tDisease\tMESH:D001987\n27709245\t485\t487\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t703\t713\tpancreatic\tDisease\tMESH:D010195\n27709245\t836\t844\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27709245\t993\t997\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27709245\t1033\t1035\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t1183\t1187\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n27709245\t1220\t1222\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t1299\t1311\tmalignancies\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n27709245\t1379\t1381\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t1390\t1398\tdiabetes\tDisease\tMESH:D003920\n27709245\t1402\t1404\tCF\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n27709245\t1413\t1426\tbone disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D001847\n27709245\t1472\t1476\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n\n'b'27888421|t|Triple-negative breast cancer has worse overall survival and cause-specific survival than non-triple-negative breast cancer.\n27888421|a|PURPOSE: The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual uses tumor size, lymph node, and metastatic status to stage breast cancer across different subtypes. We examined the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) versus non-TNBC within the same stages and sub-stages to evaluate whether TNBC had worse prognosis than non-TNBC. METHODS: We reviewed the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data and identified 158,358 patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2010 to 2012. The overall survival (OS) time and breast cancer cause-specific survival time were compared between patients with TNBC and non-TNBC in each stage and sub-stages. The results were validated using a dataset of 2049 patients with longer follow-up from our institution. RESULTS: Compared with patients with non-TNBC, patients with TNBC had worse OS and breast cancer cause-specific survival time in every stage and sub-stage in univariate and multivariate analyses adjusting for age, race, tumor grade, and surgery and radiation treatments in the SEER data. The worse OS time in patients with TNBC was validated in our institutional dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TNBC have worse survival than patients with non-TNBC.

About 1000 genes in humans encode miRNAs, which account for approximately 3% of the human genome, and up to 30% of human protein coding genes may be regulated by miRNAs. The objective of this article is to evaluate the expression profile of four miRNAs previously implicated in triple negative breast cancer: miR-10b, miR-26a, miR-146a and miR-153, and to determine their possible interaction in triple negative and non triple negative breast cancer based on clinical outcome and the expression of BRCA1. 24 triple-negative and 13 non triple negative breast cancer cases, were studied by q-RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to determine the expression of the four studied miRNAs and the BRCA1 protein, respectively. We observed that the BRCA1 protein was absent in 62.5% of the triple negative cases. Besides, the miR-146a and miR-26a were over expressed in triple negative breast cancer. These two miRNAs, miR-10b and miR-153 were significantly associated to lymph node metastases occurrence in triple negative breast carcinoma. All the analyzed microRNAs were not associated with the expression of BRCA1 in our conditions.

The main clinical features are retinal dystrophy, postaxial polydactyly, obesity, different degrees of cognitive deficit, renal impairment, hypogonadism and genital malformations. The genetic explanation consists in BBS genes mutations, which encode modified proteins, altering the function of the immotile cilia. As a multitude of BBS genes mutations were described, the phenotypic aspect of these disorders varies according to that. We present the case of a 22 years old female patient, known with BBS since the age of 11 and which was diagnosed and operated for bilateral ovarian dermoid cysts, at the age of 21. We did not find a similar case in literature, regarding the association between the two disorders. We consider that our case points towards the importance of periodic imagistic evaluations [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound] of these patients, not only clinical and biological. Usually, the moment they are diagnosed with hypogonadism or genital malformations (in childhood or adolescence), the genital evaluation is neglected thereafter. We also consider that our therapeutic approach can be helpful in other similar clinical situations. Another important conclusion is represented by the importance of genetic counseling of the relatives of a BBS patient, unfortunately insufficiently provided in our region.\n28174811\t0\t17\tOvarian teratomas\tDisease\tMESH:C562731\n28174811\t23\t30\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28174811\t36\t57\tBardet-Biedl syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n28174811\t102\t105\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n28174811\t125\t165\tciliopathy recessive autosomal inherited\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n28174811\t198\t215\tretinal dystrophy\tDisease\tMESH:D058499\n28174811\t217\t238\tpostaxial polydactyly\tDisease\tMESH:C562429\n28174811\t240\t247\tobesity\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n28174811\t270\t345\tcognitive deficit, renal impairment, hypogonadism and genital malformations\tDisease\tMESH:D003072\n28174811\t383\t386\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n28174811\t499\t502\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n28174811\t647\t654\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28174811\t667\t670\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n28174811\t732\t763\tbilateral ovarian dermoid cysts\tDisease\tMESH:D010051\n28174811\t1056\t1064\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28174811\t1144\t1181\thypogonadism or genital malformations\tDisease\tMESH:D007006\n28174811\t1467\t1470\tBBS\tDisease\tMESH:D020788\n28174811\t1471\t1478\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'28198380|t|A novel orally bioavailable compound KPT-9274 inhibits PAK4, and blocks triple negative breast cancer tumor growth.\n28198380|a|Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease consisting of several subtypes. Among these subtypes, triple negative breast cancer is particularly difficult to treat. This is due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms behind the disease, and consequently a lack of druggable targets. PAK4 plays critical roles in cell survival, proliferation, and morphology. PAK4 protein levels are high in breast cancer cells and breast tumors, and the gene is often amplified in basal like breast cancers, which are frequently triple negative. PAK4 is also overexpressed in other types of cancer, making it a promising drug target. However, its inhibition is complicated by the fact that PAK4 has both kinase-dependent and -independent functions. Here we investigate a new clinical compound KPT-9274, which has been shown to inhibit PAK4 and NAMPT. We find that KPT-9274 (and its analog, KPT-8752) can reduce the steady state level of PAK4 protein in triple negative breast cancer cells. These compounds also block the growth of the breast cancer cells in vitro, and stimulate apoptosis. Most importantly, oral administration of KPT-9274 reduces tumorigenesis in mouse models of human triple negative breast cancer. Our results indicate that KPT-9274 is a novel therapeutic option for triple negative breast cancer therapy.\n28198380\t37\t45\tKPT-9274\tChemical\tMESH:C585161\n28198380\t55\t59\tPAK4\tGene\t10298\n28198380\t88\t107\tbreast cancer tumor\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t116\t129\tBreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t227\t240\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t400\t404\tPAK4\tGene\t10298\n28198380\t475\t479\tPAK4\tGene\t10298\n28198380\t507\t520\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t531\t544\tbreast tumors\tDisease\tMESH:D061325\n28198380\t592\t606\tbreast cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t646\t650\tPAK4\tGene\t10298\n28198380\t691\t697\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n28198380\t790\t794\tPAK4\tGene\t10298\n28198380\t893\t901\tKPT-9274\tChemical\tMESH:C585161\n28198380\t935\t939\tPAK4\tGene\t10298\n28198380\t944\t949\tNAMPT\tGene\t10135\n28198380\t964\t972\tKPT-9274\tChemical\tMESH:C585161\n28198380\t990\t998\tKPT-8752\tChemical\tMESH:C008377\n28198380\t1037\t1041\tPAK4\tGene\t10298\n28198380\t1069\t1082\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t1135\t1148\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t1231\t1239\tKPT-9274\tChemical\tMESH:C585161\n28198380\t1265\t1270\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n28198380\t1281\t1286\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n28198380\t1303\t1316\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28198380\t1344\t1352\tKPT-9274\tChemical\tMESH:C585161\n28198380\t1403\t1416\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n\n'b"28377481|t|Characterization of an Immunogenic Mutation in a Patient with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.\n28377481|a|Purpose: The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can mediate durable tumor regressions in patients with melanoma likely based on the recognition of immunogenic somatic mutations expressed by the cancer. There are limited data regarding the immunogenicity of mutations in breast cancer. We sought to identify immunogenic nonsynonymous mutations in a patient with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to identify and isolate mutation-reactive TILs for possible use in adoptive cell transfer.Experimental Design: A TNBC metastasis was resected for TIL generation and whole-exome sequencing. Tandem minigenes or long 25-mer peptides encoding selected mutations were electroporated or pulsed onto autologous antigen-presenting cells, and reactivity of TIL was screened by upregulation of CD137 and IFN\xce\xb3 ELISPOT. The nature of the T-cell response against a unique nonsynonymous mutation was characterized.Results: We identified 72 nonsynonymous mutations from the tumor of a patient with TNBC. CD4(+) and HLA-DRB1*1501-restricted TILs isolated from this tumor recognized a single mutation in RBPJ (recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region). Analysis of 16 metastatic sites revealed that the mutation was ubiquitously present in all samples.Conclusions: Breast cancers can express naturally processed and presented unique nonsynonymous mutations that are recognized by a patient's immune system. TILs recognizing these immunogenic mutations can be isolated from a patient's tumor, suggesting that adoptive cell transfer of mutation-reactive TILs could be a viable treatment option for patients with breast cancer.

METHODS: Extensive literature search using individual and a combination of key words related to cystic fibrosis therapeutics. KEY FINDINGS: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in CFTR gene leading to abnormality of chloride channels in mucus and sweat producing cells. Respiratory system and GIT are primarily involved but eventually multiple organs are affected leading to life threatening complications. Management requires drug therapy, extensive physiotherapy and nutritional support. Previously, the focus was on symptomatic improvement and complication prevention but recently the protein rectifiers are being studied which are claimed to correct underlying structural and functional abnormalities. Some improvement is observed by the corrector drugs. Other promising approaches are gene therapy, targeting of cellular interactomes, and newer drugs for symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment has a long way to go as most of the existing therapeutics is for older children. Other limiting factors include mutation class, genetic profile, drug interactions, adverse effects, and cost. Novel approaches like gene transfer/gene editing, disease modeling and search for alternative targets are warranted.\n28449677\t0\t15\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28449677\t187\t202\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28449677\t339\t354\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28449677\t383\t398\tCystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28449677\t405\t433\tautosomal recessive disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n28449677\t454\t458\tCFTR\tGene\t1080\n28449677\t490\t498\tchloride\tChemical\tMESH:D002712\n28449677\t954\t978\tfunctional abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D000014\n28449677\t1257\t1265\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'28539217|t|Cystic Fibrosis Papers of the Year 2016.\n28539217|a|This is arguably the most exciting era in the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) with the emergence of potentially disease modifying therapies.

In this study, we evaluated the anticancer properties of cardiac glycoside Digitoxin (Dtx) and its synthetic analog MonoD on breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer) and MDA-MB-468 (triple-negative breast cancer). Both cardiac glycosides, at concentrations within the therapeutic range, increased the fraction of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, decreased viability, and inhibited the migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Both cardiac glycosides increased production of superoxide and induced apoptosis in both cell types. Reduced protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B and IkappaB kinase-beta were found in cardiac glycoside-treated cells, indicating that the cellular effects of these compounds are mediated via nuclear factor kappa B pathway. This study demonstrates the cytotoxic potential of digitoxin, and more importantly its synthetic analog MonoD, in the treatment of triple-positive breast cancer and more importantly the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer.

In the last decade, defects in several other proteins involved in the normal processing of type 1 collagen have been described. Recent advances in genetics have called for reconsideration of the classification of OI, however, most recent classifications align with the classic clinical classification by Sillence. The hallmark of the disease is bone fragility but other tissues are also affected. Intravenous bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most widely used intervention, having significant favorable effects regarding areal bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral reshaping following fractures in growing children. BPs have a modest effect in long bone fracture incidence, their effects in adults with OI concerns only BMD, while there are reports of subtrochanteric fractures resembling atypical femoral fractures.

More importantly, intrinsic or developed resistance to chemotherapeutic regimens and disappointing outcomes of trials associated with many newly developed agents are other obstacles in establishment of a durable response in these patients. Interestingly, these happen despite the outstanding preclinical outcomes observed by these agents, most importantly among them, targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Pursuing these disappointing outcomes, especially in the case of targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, many researches have focused on identification of the hidden factors involved. Highly inflammatory, rich in reactive oxygen species, and hypoxic microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer tumors and the involving mediators were the first suggestions for observed resistance and poor clinical outcomes of targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Interestingly, for all aberrantly expressed mediators observed in microenvironment, downstream pathways converge in a common node, nothing but the nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB, the insidious factor proposed to be the cause of many events opposing achievement of a desired outcome. In first section of current review, we describe the signaling pathways underlying activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and their convergence at the nuclear factor-\xce\xbaB node, and in next section, we demonstrate how unique hypoxic, inflammatory, rich in free-radical microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer exacerbate pathways in which otherwise could become mostly suppressed by receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n28653902\t49\t57\ttyrosine\tChemical\t\n28653902\t95\t108\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28653902\t190\t204\tbreast cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28653902\t233\t239\tdeaths\tDisease\tMESH:D003643\n28653902\t276\t284\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28653902\t311\t324\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28653902\t361\t374\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28653902\t614\t622\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28653902\t770\t778\ttyrosine\tChemical\t\n28653902\t881\t889\ttyrosine\tChemical\t\n28653902\t1026\t1032\toxygen\tChemical\tMESH:D010100\n28653902\t1046\t1053\thypoxic\tDisease\tMESH:D000860\n28653902\t1090\t1110\tbreast cancer tumors\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28653902\t1238\t1246\ttyrosine\tChemical\t\n28653902\t1641\t1649\ttyrosine\tChemical\t\n28653902\t1758\t1765\thypoxic\tDisease\tMESH:D000860\n28653902\t1838\t1851\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28653902\t1934\t1942\ttyrosine\tChemical\t\n\n'b'28689307|t|Long-term follow-up in osteogenesis imperfecta type VI.\n28689307|a|This retrospective study on long-term outcomes in osteogenesis imperfecta type VI found that patients who received intravenous bisphosphonate treatment had an increase in lumbar spine areal bone mineral density, a higher final height z-score, and some reshaping of vertebral bodies. INTRODUCTION: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VI is an ultra-rare bone fragility disorder caused by recessive mutations in SERPINF1. Here, we describe long-term outcomes in OI type VI and compare the clinical phenotypes caused by different types of SERPINF1 mutations. METHODS: This study includes a retrospective chart review of 13 individuals with OI type VI. RESULTS: In the absence of therapy, lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (BMD) did not increase during childhood and longitudinal growth seemed to stall after the age of 6 to 8\xc2\xa0years. The phenotype was similar between individuals with different types of SERPINF1 mutations. Intravenous bisphosphonate treatment was associated with an increase in lumbar spine areal BMD and some reshaping of compressed vertebral bodies. Patients who had started bisphosphonate treatment early (before the age of 6\xc2\xa0years) were taller than patients who had received bisphosphonate treatment later during their growing years. Lower extremity fractures were frequent despite bisphosphonate treatment and scoliosis was present in all patients who had reached the final height. Most patients had restricted mobility. In four patients, intravenous bisphosphonate treatment was eventually substituted by subcutaneous injections of denosumab, without clear changes in the clinical picture. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OI type VI who received intravenous bisphosphonate treatment during growth had an increase in lumbar spine areal BMD, a higher final height z-score, and presented some reshaping of vertebral bodies. More effective treatment modalities are clearly required in OI type VI.\n28689307\t23\t54\tosteogenesis imperfecta type VI\tDisease\tMESH:C567041\n28689307\t106\t137\tosteogenesis imperfecta type VI\tDisease\tMESH:C567041\n28689307\t149\t157\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28689307\t183\t197\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28689307\t353\t376\tOsteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n28689307\t407\t430\tbone fragility disorder\tDisease\tMESH:C536063\n28689307\t464\t472\tSERPINF1\tGene\t5176\n28689307\t514\t524\tOI type VI\tDisease\tMESH:C567041\n28689307\t590\t598\tSERPINF1\tGene\t5176\n28689307\t691\t701\tOI type VI\tDisease\tMESH:C567041\n28689307\t780\t783\tBMD\tDisease\t\n28689307\t960\t968\tSERPINF1\tGene\t5176\n28689307\t992\t1006\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28689307\t1071\t1074\tBMD\tDisease\t\n28689307\t1126\t1134\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28689307\t1151\t1165\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28689307\t1227\t1235\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28689307\t1253\t1267\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28689307\t1328\t1337\tfractures\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n28689307\t1360\t1374\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28689307\t1389\t1398\tscoliosis\tDisease\tMESH:D012600\n28689307\t1418\t1426\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28689307\t1466\t1474\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28689307\t1508\t1516\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28689307\t1530\t1544\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28689307\t1683\t1691\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28689307\t1697\t1707\tOI type VI\tDisease\tMESH:C567041\n28689307\t1733\t1747\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28689307\t1810\t1813\tBMD\tDisease\t\n28689307\t1956\t1966\tOI type VI\tDisease\tMESH:C567041\n\n'b'28786882|t|How can the cystic fibrosis respiratory microbiome influence our clinical decision-making?\n28786882|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Almost 15 years have now passed since bacterial community profiling techniques were first used to analyse respiratory samples from people with cystic fibrosis. Since then, many different analytical approaches have been used to try to better understand the contribution of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiota to disease, with varying degrees of success. We examine the extent to which cystic fibrosis respiratory microbiome research has been successful in informing clinical decision-making, and highlight areas that we believe have the potential to yield important insight. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome can be broadly divided into efforts to better characterize microbiota composition, particularly relative to key clinical events, and attempts to understand the cystic fibrosis lung microbiology as an interactive microbial system. The latter, in particular, has led to the development of a number of models in which microbiome-mediated processes precipitate clinical events. SUMMARY: Growing technological sophistication is enabling increasingly detailed microbiological data to be generated from cystic fibrosis respiratory samples. However, translating these data into clinically useful measures that accurately predict outcomes and guide treatments remains a formidable challenge. The development of systems biology approaches that enable the integration of complex microbiome and host-derived data provide an exciting opportunity to address this goal.\n28786882\t12\t27\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28786882\t148\t157\tbacterial\tSpecies\t2\n28786882\t241\t247\tpeople\tSpecies\t9606\n28786882\t253\t268\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28786882\t386\t406\tcystic fibrosis lung\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28786882\t494\t521\tcystic fibrosis respiratory\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28786882\t724\t744\tcystic fibrosis lung\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28786882\t916\t936\tcystic fibrosis lung\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n28786882\t1252\t1267\tcystic fibrosis\tDisease\tMESH:D003550\n\n'b'28863000|t|Osteogenesis imperfecta: diagnosis and treatment.\n28863000|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Here we summarize the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta, discuss newly discovered genes involved in osteogenesis imperfecta, and review the management of this disease in children and adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations in the two genes coding for collagen type I, COL1A1 and COL1A2, are the most common cause of osteogenesis imperfecta. In the past 10 years, defects in at least 17 other genes have been identified as responsible for osteogenesis imperfecta phenotypes, with either dominant or recessive transmission. Intravenous bisphosphonate infusions are the most widely used medical treatment. This has a marked effect on vertebra in growing children and can lead to vertebral reshaping after compression fractures. However, bisphosphonates are less effective for preventing long-bone fractures. At the moment, new therapies are under investigation. SUMMARY: Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta, more research is needed. Bisphosphonate treatment decreases long-bone fracture rates, but such fractures are still frequent. New antiresorptive and anabolic agents are being investigated but efficacy and safety of these drugs, especially in children, need to be better established before they can be used in clinical practice.\n28863000\t0\t23\tOsteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n28863000\t104\t127\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n28863000\t172\t195\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n28863000\t242\t250\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n28863000\t335\t341\tCOL1A1\tGene\t1277\n28863000\t346\t352\tCOL1A2\tGene\t1278\n28863000\t383\t406\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n28863000\t505\t528\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n28863000\t601\t615\tbisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28863000\t718\t726\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n28863000\t781\t790\tfractures\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n28863000\t801\t816\tbisphosphonates\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28863000\t861\t870\tfractures\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n28863000\t986\t1009\tosteogenesis imperfecta\tDisease\tMESH:D010013\n28863000\t1036\t1050\tBisphosphonate\tChemical\tMESH:D004164\n28863000\t1106\t1115\tfractures\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n28863000\t1252\t1260\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'28958991|t|Pathway-enriched gene signature associated with 53BP1 response to PARP inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer.\n28958991|a|Treatment of patients with triple negative (ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-negative) breast cancer remains a challenge. Although PARP inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials, biomarkers are needed to identify patients that will most benefit from anti-PARP therapy. We determined the response of three PARP inhibitors: veliparib, olaparib, and talazoparib in a panel of eight triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Therapeutic responses and cellular phenotypes were elucidated using high-content imaging and quantitative immunofluorescence to assess markers of DNA damage (53BP1) and apoptosis (cleaved-PARP). We determined the pharmacodynamic changes in percentage of cells positive for 53BP1, mean number of 53BP1 foci per cell, and percentage of cells positive for cleaved-PARP. Inspired by traditional dose-response measures of cell viability, an EC50 value was calculated for each cellular phenotype for each PARP inhibitor. The EC50 values for both 53BP1 metrics strongly correlated with IC50 values for each PARP inhibitor. Pathway enrichment analysis identified a set of DNA repair and cell cycle associated genes that were associated with 53BP1 response following PARP inhibition. The overall accuracy of our 63 gene set in predicting response to olaparib in seven breast cancer patient-derived xenograft tumors was 86%. In triple-negative breast cancer patients not treated with anti-PARP therapy, the predicted response rate of our gene signature was 45%. These results indicate that 53BP1 is a biomarker of response to anti-PARP therapy in the laboratory, and our DNA damage response gene signature may be used to identify patients who are most likely to respond to PARP inhibition.\n28958991\t50\t53\tBP1\tGene\t474256\n28958991\t66\t70\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t101\t114\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28958991\t129\t137\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28958991\t186\t190\tHER2\tGene\t2064\n28958991\t201\t214\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28958991\t245\t249\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t335\t343\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28958991\t377\t381\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t427\t431\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t469\t480\ttalazoparib\tChemical\tMESH:C586365\n28958991\t517\t530\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28958991\t703\t706\tBP1\tGene\t474256\n28958991\t731\t735\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t816\t821\t53BP1\tGene\t7158\n28958991\t838\t843\t53BP1\tGene\t7158\n28958991\t904\t908\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t1042\t1046\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t1083\t1088\t53BP1\tGene\t7158\n28958991\t1143\t1147\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t1276\t1281\t53BP1\tGene\t7158\n28958991\t1301\t1305\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t1402\t1415\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28958991\t1416\t1423\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28958991\t1442\t1448\ttumors\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n28958991\t1477\t1490\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28958991\t1491\t1499\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28958991\t1522\t1526\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t1623\t1628\t53BP1\tGene\t7158\n28958991\t1664\t1668\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n28958991\t1763\t1771\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28958991\t1806\t1810\tPARP\tGene\t1302\n\n'b"29039417|t|Protein interaction perturbation profiling at amino-acid resolution.\n29039417|a|The identification of genomic variants in healthy and diseased individuals continues to rapidly outpace our ability to functionally annotate these variants.

Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic effect of an anthracycline drug, epirubicin (EPI)-loaded polymeric micelles equipped with pH-triggered drug release property (EPI/m) against ALNM of TNBC. EPI/m effectively inhibited the spread of the primary tumor and the growth of ALNM, through selective accumulation and penetration in both primary tumor and vascularized ALNM, as well as efficient drug activation triggered by the intratumoral acidic environment. Furthermore, we revealed that the improvement of the activated drug distribution of EPI/m contributed to dose-dependent enhancement of the antitumor effect through expansion of the therapeutic window.

AR-C155858 inhibited the cellular L-lactate uptake and cellular proliferation at low nanomolar potencies (IC50 values of 25.0 +- 4.2 and 20.2 +- 0.2 nM, respectively). In the xenograft 4T1 mouse model of immunocompetent animals, AR-C155858 (10 mg/kg i.p. once daily) had no effect on tumor volume and weight. Treatment with AR-C155858 resulted in slightly increased tumor lactate concentrations; however, the changes were not statistically significant. AR-C155858 was well tolerated, as demonstrated by the unchanged body weight and blood lactate concentrations. Average blood and tumor AR-C155858 concentrations (110 +- 22 and 574 +- 245 nM, respectively), 24 h after the last dose, were well above the IC50 values. These data indicate that AR-C155858 penetrated 4T1 xenograft tumors and was present at high concentrations but was ineffective in decreasing tumor growth. Evaluations of AR-C155858 in other preclinical models of breast cancer are needed to further assess its efficacy.\n30397860\t37\t66\tMonocarboxylate Transporter 1\tGene\t20501\n30397860\t80\t87\tC155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t95\t105\tMurine 4T1\tCellLine\tCVCL:0125\n30397860\t106\t125\tBreast Cancer Tumor\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30397860\t133\t162\tMonocarboxylate transporter 1\tGene\t20501\n30397860\t164\t168\tMCT1\tGene\t20501\n30397860\t187\t196\tL-lactate\tChemical\tMESH:D019344\n30397860\t247\t253\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30397860\t359\t369\tAR-C155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t394\t398\tMCT1\tGene\t20501\n30397860\t413\t419\tmurine\tSpecies\t10090\n30397860\t424\t437\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30397860\t459\t464\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30397860\t541\t554\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30397860\t600\t604\tMCT1\tGene\t20501\n30397860\t609\t614\tCD147\tGene\t12215\n30397860\t618\t622\tMCT1\tGene\t20501\n30397860\t658\t662\tMCT4\tGene\t80879\n30397860\t678\t685\tC155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t709\t718\tL-lactate\tChemical\tMESH:D019344\n30397860\t864\t869\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n30397860\t904\t914\tAR-C155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t959\t964\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30397860\t999\t1009\tAR-C155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t1041\t1046\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30397860\t1047\t1054\tlactate\tChemical\tMESH:D019344\n30397860\t1131\t1138\tC155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t1214\t1221\tlactate\tChemical\tMESH:D019344\n30397860\t1256\t1261\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30397860\t1265\t1272\tC155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t1420\t1427\tC155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t1453\t1459\ttumors\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30397860\t1533\t1538\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30397860\t1562\t1572\tAR-C155858\tChemical\tMESH:C546977\n30397860\t1604\t1617\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n\n'b'30405852|t|Oestrogen Inhibits VEGF Expression And Angiogenesis In Triple-Negative Breast Cancer By Activating GPER-1.\n30405852|a|Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant type of breast cancer with ample vascularisation and high vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. The sex steroid hormone oestrogen is involved in several cellular activities associated with TNBC regulation. However, the role of oestrogen in VEGF expression and angiogenesis in TNBC remains unclear. In this study, we found that treatment with 17beta-oestradiol (E2) inhibited VEGF mRNA and protein expression in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-436. To further elaborate on the phenomenon of E2-regulated angiogenesis, we showed that conditioned medium from the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468 treated with E2 inhibits the tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, the G-protein-coupled oestrogen receptor-1 (GPER-1)-specific agonist G-1 has a function similar to that of E2. While G-15, the selective antagonist of GPER-1, notably reversed the inhibitory effects of E2 and G-1 on VEGF expression and tube formation, suggesting that GPER-1 is involved in the E2-induced angiogenesis suppression in TNBC cells. Moreover, E2 inhibited in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis and reduced the expression levels of VEGF, NF-kappaB/p65, STAT3, and the endothelial marker CD34 in MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumours. Our findings provide important evidence that E2 can inhibit VEGF expression and angiogenesis in TNBC by activating GPER-1, offering additional insight into tumour angiogenesis and targets for drug intervention in TNBC.\n30405852\t0\t9\tOestrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n30405852\t19\t23\tVEGF\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t71\t84\tBreast Cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30405852\t99\t105\tGPER-1\tGene\t2852\n30405852\t123\t136\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30405852\t166\t187\ttype of breast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30405852\t224\t258\tvascular endothelial growth factor\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t260\t264\tVEGF\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t286\t293\tsteroid\tChemical\tMESH:D013256\n30405852\t302\t311\toestrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n30405852\t409\t418\toestrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n30405852\t422\t426\tVEGF\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t524\t541\t17beta-oestradiol\tChemical\tMESH:D004958\n30405852\t557\t561\tVEGF\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t613\t623\tMDA-MB-468\tCellLine\tCVCL:0419\n30405852\t628\t638\tMDA-MB-436\tCellLine\tCVCL:0623\n30405852\t767\t777\tMDA-MB-468\tCellLine\tCVCL:0419\n30405852\t833\t838\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n30405852\t900\t938\tG-protein-coupled oestrogen receptor-1\tGene\t2852\n30405852\t940\t946\tGPER-1\tGene\t2852\n30405852\t1047\t1053\tGPER-1\tGene\t2852\n30405852\t1098\t1108\tE2 and G-1\tGene\t106478911;5544\n30405852\t1112\t1116\tVEGF\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t1164\t1170\tGPER-1\tGene\t2852\n30405852\t1272\t1278\ttumour\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30405852\t1340\t1344\tVEGF\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t1403\t1413\tMDA-MB-468\tCellLine\tCVCL:0419\n30405852\t1414\t1431\txenograft tumours\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30405852\t1493\t1497\tVEGF\tGene\t7422\n30405852\t1548\t1554\tGPER-1\tGene\t2852\n30405852\t1589\t1595\ttumour\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n\n'b'30419345|t|Immunological therapy: A novel thriving area for triple-negative breast cancer treatment.\n30419345|a|Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to cancers that are low in expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC tends to behave more aggressively than other types of breast cancer. Unlike other breast cancer subtypes (ie, ER-positive, HER2-positive subtypes), there are no approved targeted treatments available, other than the administration of chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is a new kind of treatment approach for TNBC when compared with the surgical treatment, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and molecular targeting therapy. The present article reviews the research progresses of immunotherapy for TNBC in recent years.

The clinical prognosis of TNBC is poorer than other types of breast cancer, and there is no effective therapy strategy until now. Thus, it is necessary to determine important factors involved in regulating the progression of TNBC. In this study, we found DEPDC1 was up-regulated in the tissues of TNBC compared with their paired peritumoral tissues. DEPDC1 over-expression facilitated cell proliferation and tumor growth through increasing the expression of FOXM1 in TNBC cells. Conversely, knockdown of DEPDC1 had the opposite effects. Moreover, miR-26b, acting as a tumor suppressor in TNBC, directly repressed the expression of DEPDC1 and mitigated its promotive effects on cell growth and colony formation. These results indicate that DEPDC1, negatively regulated by miR-26b, promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth via up-regulating FOXM1 expression, implying an important underlying mechanism of regulating the progression of TNBC.\n30419349\t0\t6\tDEPDC1\tGene\t55635\n30419349\t32\t39\tmiR-26b\tGene\t407017\n30419349\t97\t102\tFOXM1\tGene\t2305\n30419349\t139\t152\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30419349\t186\t194\testrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n30419349\t206\t218\tprogesterone\tChemical\tMESH:D011374\n30419349\t242\t246\tHER2\tGene\t2064\n30419349\t295\t300\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30419349\t407\t420\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n30419349\t601\t607\tDEPDC1\tGene\t55635\n30419349\t696\t702\tDEPDC1\tGene\t55635\n30419349\t754\t759\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30419349\t804\t809\tFOXM1\tGene\t2305\n30419349\t850\t856\tDEPDC1\tGene\t55635\n30419349\t893\t900\tmiR-26b\tGene\t407017\n30419349\t914\t919\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30419349\t977\t983\tDEPDC1\tGene\t55635\n30419349\t1085\t1091\tDEPDC1\tGene\t55635\n30419349\t1117\t1124\tmiR-26b\tGene\t407017\n30419349\t1158\t1163\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30419349\t1189\t1194\tFOXM1\tGene\t2305\n\n'
