A distinct subgroup of individuals with Marfan syndrome have distal airspace enlargement, historically described as emphysema, which frequently results in spontaneous lung rupture (pneumothorax; refs. 1-3). To investigate the pathogenesis of genetically imposed emphysema, we analyzed the lung phenotype of mice deficient in fibrillin-1, an accepted model of Marfan syndrome. Lung abnormalities are evident in the immediate postnatal period and manifest as a developmental impairment of distal alveolar septation. Aged mice deficient in fibrillin-1 develop destructive emphysema consistent with the view that early developmental perturbations can predispose to late-onset, seemingly acquired phenotypes. We show that mice deficient in fibrillin-1 have marked dysregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activation and signaling, resulting in apoptosis in the developing lung. Perinatal antagonism of TGF-beta attenuates apoptosis and rescues alveolar septation in vivo. These data indicate that matrix sequestration of cytokines is crucial to their regulated activation and signaling and that perturbation of this function can contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.\n12598898\t68\t83\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n12598898\t85\t100\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n12598898\t107\t134\tautosomal dominant disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n12598898\t179\t190\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t2200\n12598898\t203\t207\tFBN1\tGene\t2200\n12598898\t211\t217\thumans\tSpecies\t9606\n12598898\t222\t226\tFbn1\tGene\t2200\n12598898\t230\t234\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n12598898\t327\t342\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n12598898\t403\t412\temphysema\tDisease\tMESH:D004646\n12598898\t454\t466\tlung rupture\tDisease\tMESH:D012421\n12598898\t549\t558\temphysema\tDisease\tMESH:D004646\n12598898\t594\t598\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n12598898\t612\t623\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t14118\n12598898\t646\t661\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n12598898\t663\t681\tLung abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:C567034\n12598898\t746\t799\tdevelopmental impairment of distal alveolar septation\tDisease\tMESH:D002282\n12598898\t806\t810\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n12598898\t824\t835\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t14118\n12598898\t856\t865\temphysema\tDisease\tMESH:D004646\n12598898\t1004\t1008\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n12598898\t1022\t1033\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t14118\n\n'b'14707528|t|Are there socio-economic inequalities in age of resection of colorectal cancer in people with HNPCC?\n14707528|a|The relationship between socio-economic status and health has been consistently reported and is thought to be causal. Socio-economic inequalities are present in the incidence of and mortality from cancer in general, but not in the incidence of colorectal cancer in particular. However, there are socio-economic gradients in mortality from colorectal cancer. The socio-economic distribution of incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer in individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome) is not known. It is possible that increased awareness of and access to screening for colorectal cancer amongst this group of individuals reduces the socio-economic gradients seen in the population as a whole. We investigated the relationship between socio-economic status and age of resection of colorectal cancer in a cohort of individuals with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer. More affluent individuals tended to undergo surgical resection for colorectal cancers earlier in their lives than less affluent individuals. This relationship was bordering on statistical significance. This trend probably represents socio-economic variations in access to treatment. In addition, age based diagnostic criteria for hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer may, inadvertently, accentuate socio-economic inequalities in outcome.\n14707528\t61\t78\tcolorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n14707528\t82\t88\tpeople\tSpecies\t9606\n14707528\t94\t99\tHNPCC\tDisease\t\n14707528\t298\t304\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n14707528\t345\t362\tcolorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n14707528\t440\t457\tcolorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n14707528\t526\t543\tcolorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n14707528\t564\t601\thereditary non-polyposis colon cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n14707528\t603\t617\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n14707528\t704\t721\tcolorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n14707528\t915\t932\tcolorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n14707528\t965\t1002\thereditary non-polyposis colon cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n14707528\t1071\t1089\tcolorectal cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n14707528\t1334\t1371\thereditary non-polyposis colon cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n\n'b''b'17487218|t|Marfan syndrome: clinical diagnosis and management.\n17487218|a|Marfan syndrome is a multisystem connective tissue disorder usually associated with mutation in fibrillin, and occasionally with mutation in TGFBR1 or 2. The clinical diagnosis is made using the Ghent nosology, which will unequivocally diagnose or exclude Marfan syndrome in 86% of cases. Use of a care pathway can help implementation of the nosology in the clinic. The penetrance of some features is age dependent, so the nosology must be used with caution in children. Molecular testing may be helpful in this context. The nosology cannot be used in families with isolated aortic dissection, or with related conditions such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome, although it may help identify families for further diagnostic evaluation because they do not fulfill the nosology, despite a history of aneurysm. Prophylactic medical (eg beta-blockade) and surgical intervention is important in reducing the cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome. Musculoskeletal symptoms are common, although the pathophysiology is less clear--for example, the correlation between dural ectasia and back pain is uncertain. Symptoms in other systems require specialist review such as ophthalmology assessment of refractive errors and ectopia lentis. Pregnancy is a time of increased cardiovascular risk for women with Marfan syndrome, particularly if the aortic root exceeds 4 cm at the start of pregnancy. High-intensity static exercise should be discouraged although low-moderate intensity dynamic exercise may be beneficial. The diagnosis and management of Marfan syndrome requires a multidisciplinary team approach, in view of its multisystem effects and phenotypic variability.\n17487218\t193\t199\tTGFBR1\tGene\t7046\n17487218\t308\t323\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n17487218\t513\t521\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n17487218\t681\t701\tLoeys-Dietz syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D055947\n17487218\t839\t847\taneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D000783\n17487218\t944\t991\tcardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D002318\n17487218\t993\t1017\tMusculoskeletal symptoms\tDisease\tMESH:D006970\n17487218\t1111\t1138\tdural ectasia and back pain\tDisease\tMESH:D001416\n17487218\t1263\t1277\tectopia lentis\tDisease\tMESH:D004479\n17487218\t1336\t1341\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n17487218\t1347\t1362\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n17487218\t1589\t1604\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n\n'b'17708142|t|Turner syndrome: diagnosis and management.\n17708142|a|Turner syndrome occurs in one out of every 2,500 to 3,000 live female births. The syndrome is characterized by the partial or complete absence of one X chromosome (45,X karyotype). Patients with Turner syndrome are at risk of congenital heart defects (e.g., coarctation of aorta, bicuspid aortic valve) and may have progressive aortic root dilatation or dissection. These patients also are at risk of congenital lymphedema, renal malformation, sensorineural hearing loss, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, and atherogenic lipid profile. Patients usually have normal intelligence but may have problems with nonverbal, social, and psychomotor skills. Physical manifestations may be subtle but can include misshapen ears, a webbed neck, a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, and cubitus valgus. A Turner syndrome diagnosis should be considered in girls with short stature or primary amenorrhea. Patients are treated for short stature in early childhood with growth hormone therapy, and supplemental estrogen is initiated by adolescence for pubertal development and prevention of osteoporosis. Almost all women with Turner syndrome are infertile, although some conceive with assisted reproduction.\n17708142\t0\t15\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n17708142\t224\t232\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n17708142\t238\t253\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n17708142\t269\t293\tcongenital heart defects\tDisease\tMESH:D006330\n17708142\t301\t321\tcoarctation of aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n17708142\t323\t344\tbicuspid aortic valve\tDisease\tMESH:C562388\n17708142\t371\t393\taortic root dilatation\tDisease\tMESH:D002311\n17708142\t415\t423\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n17708142\t444\t465\tcongenital lymphedema\tDisease\tMESH:D008209\n17708142\t467\t485\trenal malformation\tDisease\tMESH:D007674\n17708142\t487\t513\tsensorineural hearing loss\tDisease\tMESH:D006319\n17708142\t515\t527\tosteoporosis\tDisease\tMESH:D010024\n17708142\t529\t536\tobesity\tDisease\tMESH:D009765\n17708142\t538\t546\tdiabetes\tDisease\tMESH:D003920\n17708142\t579\t587\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n17708142\t671\t689\tpsychomotor skills\tDisease\tMESH:D019957\n17708142\t822\t836\tcubitus valgus\tDisease\tMESH:C564510\n17708142\t840\t855\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n17708142\t890\t895\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n17708142\t901\t914\tshort stature\tDisease\tMESH:D006130\n17708142\t926\t936\tamenorrhea\tDisease\tMESH:D000568\n17708142\t938\t946\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n17708142\t963\t976\tshort stature\tDisease\tMESH:D006130\n17708142\t1042\t1050\testrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n17708142\t1122\t1134\tosteoporosis\tDisease\tMESH:D010024\n17708142\t1147\t1152\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n17708142\t1158\t1173\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n17708142\t1178\t1187\tinfertile\tDisease\tMESH:D007246\n\n'b'20351703|t|Marfan syndrome. Part 1: pathophysiology and diagnosis.\n20351703|a|Marfan syndrome is a connective-tissue disease inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and caused mainly by mutations in the gene FBN1. This gene encodes fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein that is the main constituent of the microfibrils of the extracellular matrix. Most mutations are unique and affect a single amino acid of the protein. Reduced or abnormal fibrillin-1 leads to tissue weakness, increased transforming growth factor beta signaling, loss of cell-matrix interactions, and, finally, to the different phenotypic manifestations of Marfan syndrome. Since the description of FBN1 as the gene affected in patients with this disorder, great advances have been made in the understanding of its pathogenesis. The development of several mouse models has also been crucial to our increased understanding of this disease, which is likely to change the treatment and the prognosis of patients in the coming years. Among the many different clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome, cardiovascular involvement deserves special consideration, owing to its impact on prognosis. However, the diagnosis of patients with Marfan syndrome should be made according to Ghent criteria and requires a comprehensive clinical assessment of multiple organ systems. Genetic testing can be useful in the diagnosis of selected cases.\n20351703\t188\t192\tFBN1\tGene\t2200\n20351703\t212\t223\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t2200\n20351703\t411\t422\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t2200\n20351703\t439\t447\tweakness\tDisease\tMESH:D018908\n20351703\t596\t611\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n20351703\t638\t642\tFBN1\tGene\t2200\n20351703\t667\t675\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n20351703\t795\t800\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n20351703\t939\t947\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n20351703\t1021\t1036\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n20351703\t1038\t1064\tcardiovascular involvement\tDisease\tMESH:D002318\n20351703\t1157\t1165\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n20351703\t1171\t1186\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n\n'b'20578946|t|PTPN11 and KRAS gene analysis in patients with Noonan and Noonan-like syndromes.\n20578946|a|Noonan and Noonan-like syndromes are disorders of dysregulation of the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS)-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In Noonan syndrome (NS), four genes of this pathway (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS) are responsible for roughly 70% of the cases. We analyzed PTPN11 and KRAS genes by bidirectional sequencing in 95 probands with NS and 29 with Noonan-like syndromes, including previously reported patients already screened for PTPN11 gene mutations. In the new patients with NS, 20/46 (43%) showed a PTPN11 gene mutation, two of them novel. In our total cohort, patients with NS and a PTPN11 mutation presented significantly higher prevalence of short stature (p = 0.03) and pulmonary valve stenosis (p = 0.01), and lower prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.01). Only a single gene alteration, of uncertain role, was found in the KRAS gene in an NS patient also presenting a PTPN11 gene mutation.

Noonan syndrome is associated with dysregulation of the Ras-mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Recently, two mutations in NRAS were reported to be associated with Noonan syndrome, T50I and G60E. Here, we report a mutation in NRAS, resulting in an I24N amino acid substitution, that we identified in an individual bearing typical Noonan syndrome features. The I24N mutation activates N-Ras, resulting in enhanced downstream signaling. Expression of N-Ras-I24N, N-Ras-G60E or the strongly activating mutant N-Ras-G12V, which we included as a positive control, results in developmental defects in zebrafish embryos, demonstrating that these activating N-Ras mutants are sufficient to induce developmental disorders. The defects in zebrafish embryos are reminiscent of symptoms in individuals with Noonan syndrome and phenocopy the defects that other Noonan-syndrome-associated genes induce in zebrafish embryos. MEK inhibition completely rescued the activated N-Ras-induced phenotypes, demonstrating that these defects are mediated exclusively by Ras-MAPK signaling. In conclusion, mutations in NRAS from individuals with Noonan syndrome activated N-Ras signaling and induced developmental defects in zebrafish embryos, indicating that activating mutations in NRAS cause Noonan syndrome.\n21263000\t46\t50\tNRAS\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t57\t66\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n21263000\t67\t87\tgastrulation defects\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n21263000\t89\t104\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21263000\t128\t150\tdevelopmental disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D002658\n21263000\t210\t234\tcongenital heart defects\tDisease\tMESH:D006330\n21263000\t236\t251\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21263000\t382\t386\tNRAS\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t423\t438\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21263000\t440\t444\tT50I\tProteinMutation\tp.T50I;RS#:267606921(Expired)\n21263000\t449\t453\tG60E\tProteinMutation\tp.G60E;RS#:267606920(Expired)\n21263000\t485\t489\tNRAS\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t507\t511\tI24N\tProteinMutation\tp.I24N;RS#:869025573(Expired)\n21263000\t589\t604\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21263000\t619\t623\tI24N\tProteinMutation\tp.I24N;RS#:869025573(Expired)\n21263000\t643\t648\tN-Ras\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t708\t713\tN-Ras\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t714\t718\tI24N\tProteinMutation\tp.I24N;RS#:869025573(Expired)\n21263000\t720\t725\tN-Ras\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t726\t730\tG60E\tProteinMutation\tp.G60E;RS#:267606920(Expired)\n21263000\t765\t770\tN-Ras\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t771\t775\tG12V\tProteinMutation\tp.G12V;RS#:121913237\n21263000\t829\t850\tdevelopmental defects\tDisease\tMESH:D009436\n21263000\t854\t863\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n21263000\t864\t871\tembryos\tSpecies\t6239\n21263000\t909\t914\tN-Ras\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t948\t971\tdevelopmental disorders\tDisease\tMESH:D002658\n21263000\t988\t997\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n21263000\t998\t1005\tembryos\tSpecies\t6239\n21263000\t1054\t1069\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21263000\t1074\t1095\tphenocopy the defects\tDisease\tMESH:C580174\n21263000\t1150\t1159\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n21263000\t1160\t1167\tembryos\tSpecies\t6239\n21263000\t1217\t1222\tN-Ras\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t1352\t1356\tNRAS\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t1379\t1394\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21263000\t1405\t1410\tN-Ras\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t1433\t1454\tdevelopmental defects\tDisease\tMESH:D009436\n21263000\t1458\t1467\tzebrafish\tSpecies\t7955\n21263000\t1468\t1475\tembryos\tSpecies\t6239\n21263000\t1517\t1521\tNRAS\tGene\t30380\n21263000\t1528\t1543\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n\n'b'21706501|t|Targeted ultrasound examination and DNA testing for Noonan syndrome, in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency and normal karyotype.\n21706501|a|OBJECTIVE: To define sonographic criteria that may improve the prenatal diagnosis of Noonan syndrome by targeted DNA testing. METHODS: We searched our Fetal Medicine Unit records for all cases with a final diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. A literature review was undertaken to identify the sonographic features of Noonan syndrome fetuses. Information was pooled to define the most common features. RESULTS: In our database, we identified three cases of Noonan syndrome. The diagnosis was suspected prenatally in two of them. Thirty-nine cases were identified in the literature. In the presented cases we show that suspicion of Noonan syndrome should arise when, after an increased nuchal translucency, ultrasound investigation in the second trimester shows a persistant nuchal fold (NF) or cystic hygroma in combination with at least one of the following features: hydrops fetalis, pleural effusion, cardiac anomalies, polyhydramnios or specific facial abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Prenatal ultrasound findings in Noonan syndrome can be subtle and aspecific, but when specific characteristics are present additional targeted DNA analysis is indicated.\n21706501\t52\t67\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21706501\t72\t79\tfetuses\tSpecies\t10090\n21706501\t222\t237\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21706501\t356\t371\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21706501\t448\t463\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21706501\t464\t471\tfetuses\tSpecies\t10090\n21706501\t587\t602\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21706501\t761\t776\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n21706501\t924\t938\tcystic hygroma\tDisease\tMESH:D018191\n21706501\t1016\t1032\tpleural effusion\tDisease\tMESH:D010996\n21706501\t1034\t1051\tcardiac anomalies\tDisease\tMESH:D006331\n21706501\t1053\t1067\tpolyhydramnios\tDisease\tMESH:D006831\n21706501\t1080\t1100\tfacial abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D063647\n21706501\t1146\t1161\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n\n'b'22011734|t|Rosette forming glioneuronal tumor in association with Noonan syndrome: pathobiological implications.\n22011734|a|Noonan syndrome, a distinctive syndrome characterized by dysmorphism, cardiac abnormalities and developmental delay, has been associated with a number of malignancies, however, only a few cases of primary glial or glioneuronal neoplasms have been reported.

RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we focus on the impact of the revised MFS clinical diagnostic criteria. We discuss lessons that have been learned from molecular findings in relevant Marfan-related conditions, such as sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection, stiff skin syndrome, acromelic dysplasias and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We explore the latest insights into the role of the alternative TGF-\xce\xb2 signaling pathways in MFS pathogenesis. Finally, we give an update on the current and future treatment strategies.

Steatosis, steatofibrosis and steatohepatitis are the most frequently reported lesions, caused by metabolic disorders, which are commonly related to overweight. Marked architectural changes, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia, multiple focal nodular hyperplasia and cirrhosis, found in some patients, are associated with a risk of severe liver-related complications. Architectural changes are often observed and are associated with vascular disorders caused by congenitally abnormal vessels. Finally, small bile duct alterations resembling sclerosing cholangitis occur in several patients. Oestrogen replacement therapy does not cause liver toxicity in patients with Turner syndrome and is not contraindicated in case of elevated liver enzymes. Moreover, in recent studies, oestrogen therapy was reported to improve liver function tests.

A few cases of CM-I in patients with Noonan syndrome (NS) have been reported; however, opinion remains divided as to whether the observed association is coincidental. DISCUSSION: Six previous cases of CM-I in patients with NS have been described in the literature. Many of these had other neurological abnormalities; however, neurological problems are not a prominent part of earlier descriptions of NS. A statistically significant association between NS and CM-I is difficult to obtain at present due to availability and logistical issues with scanning many asymptomatic patients. Although we believe a link exists between CM-I and NS, there is little understanding on how NS may cause CM-I. The most logical cause would be posterior fossa abnormality; however, the most common genetic mutation in NS tends to cause frontal and facial abnormalities, and the posterior fossa tends to be relatively spared. Other genetic mutations may also affect the posterior cranium and thus create the appropriate conditions for a CM-I to develop. ILLUSTRATIVE CASE: We report a case of CM-I in a 9-year-old patient with Noonan syndrome, severe scoliosis and syringomyelia. CONCLUSION: We believe that CM-I is a part of Noonan syndrome; however, statistical validation of this opinion is necessary.\n23239255\t20\t35\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t40\t61\tChiari I malformation\tDisease\tMESH:D001139\n23239255\t105\t118\tmalformations\tDisease\tMESH:D000014\n23239255\t165\t192\tdevelopmental abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D006130\n23239255\t235\t243\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23239255\t249\t264\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t266\t268\tNS\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t421\t429\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23239255\t435\t437\tNS\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t501\t527\tneurological abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D009461\n23239255\t612\t614\tNS\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t664\t666\tNS\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t784\t792\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n23239255\t845\t847\tNS\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t886\t888\tNS\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t937\t964\tposterior fossa abnormality\tDisease\tMESH:D015192\n23239255\t1011\t1013\tNS\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t1041\t1061\tfacial abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D063647\n23239255\t1172\t1179\tcranium\tChemical\t\n23239255\t1306\t1313\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n23239255\t1319\t1334\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n23239255\t1343\t1352\tscoliosis\tDisease\tMESH:D012600\n23239255\t1357\t1370\tsyringomyelia\tDisease\tMESH:D013595\n23239255\t1418\t1433\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n\n'b'23788295|t|The role of transforming growth factor-beta in Marfan syndrome.\n23788295|a|The starting point, in Marfan syndrome (MFS) appears to be the mutation of fibrillin-1 gene whose deconstructed protein product cannot bind transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), leading to an increased TGF-b tissue level.

This autosomal heritable disease is mainly attributable to a defect in the FBN1 gene. Clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome has been based on the Ghent criteria since 1996. In 2010, these criteria were updated, and the revised guidelines place more emphasis on aortic root dilation, ectopia lentis, and FBN1 mutation testing in the diagnostic assessment of Marfan syndrome. Among its many different clinical manifestations, cardiovascular involvement deserves special consideration, owing to its impact on prognosis. Recent molecular, surgical, and clinical research has yielded profound new insights into the pathological mechanisms that ultimately lead to tissue degradation and weakening of the aortic wall, which has led to exciting new treatment strategies. Furthermore, with the increasing life expectancy of patients with Marfan syndrome, there has been a subtle shift in the spectrum of medical problems. Consequently, this article focuses on recent advances to highlight their potential impact on future concepts of patient care from a clinical, surgical, and anesthetic perspective.\n24311526\t282\t286\tFBN1\tGene\t2200\n24311526\t315\t330\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n24311526\t490\t504\tectopia lentis\tDisease\tMESH:D004479\n24311526\t510\t514\tFBN1\tGene\t2200\n24311526\t564\t579\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n24311526\t631\t657\tcardiovascular involvement\tDisease\tMESH:D002318\n24311526\t1022\t1030\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24311526\t1036\t1051\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n24311526\t1232\t1239\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'24443022|t|Clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of the Marfan syndrome.\n24443022|a|Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a relatively common and often lethal disease of connective tissue. Medical, surgical and basic research advances over the last two decades have had a major positive impact on the clinical management of MFS patients. Life expectancy has increased significantly, more discriminating diagnostic criteria have been developed, a number of new clinical entities have been recognized, and exciting opportunities for drug-based therapy have emerged. Despite such a remarkable progress, MFS diagnosis remains difficult and aortic disease progression is very heterogeneous and clinical outcome is unpredictable. Ongoing research efforts are therefore exploiting animal models of MFS to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, genetic, epigenetic and environmental modifiers and druggable biological targets.\n24443022\t87\t90\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n24443022\t297\t300\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n24443022\t301\t309\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n24443022\t609\t623\taortic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D001018\n24443022\t764\t767\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n\n'b'24555249|t|[Marfan syndrome].\n24555249|a|Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue caused by mutations in FBN1 gene.

The most obvious symptoms are small stature and ovarian failure. Turner patients have an increased risk of a large number of disorders, and should therefore have lifelong medical supervision. Recent insights into patient management have been incorporated into the guidelines. Patients are increasingly involved in their own treatment. In patients with 45,X karyotype, Y-chromosomal material is actively sought in a larger number of cells and/or other tissues, using FISH. Pubertal induction therapy, if required, is initiated at an appropriate age. Egg donation or vitrification are new therapeutic options for fertility treatment. Monitoring for cardiac and vascular disease using cardiac ultrasound and MRI is performed more often, partly in connection with the risk of aortal dissection.

A mixed-method systematic review was performed by searching the published literature databases using available medical, psychological, pedagogical and social databases and other sources. All studies that addressed psychosocial aspects of MFS, published in peer-reviewed journals were assessed. Of 81 search results, 15 articles (four articles based on same study population) satisfied the eligibility criteria. All studies were cross-sectional; no intervention or randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies were found. Most studies were of small sample sizes, had low response rate or participants without a verified diagnosis. Despite these limitations, all studies described, that MFS has a significant impact on the psychosocial aspects of people's lives: Decreased quality of life; challenges in education, work and family life, depression and anxiety. Some studies indicated that the subjective perception of discomfort did not necessarily match the medical severity of a disease. The research of the psychosocial aspects of MFS is limited in size and quality.

Fibrillin-1 interacts with transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2 (TGF-\xce\xb2), and dysregulated TGF-\xce\xb2 signaling plays a major role in the development of connective tissue disease and familial aortic aneurysm and dissection, including Marfan syndrome. Losartan, an angiotensin II blocker, has the potential to reduce TGF-\xce\xb2 signaling and is expected to be an additional therapeutic option. Clinical diagnosis is made using the Ghent nosology, which requires comprehensive patient assessment and has been proven to work well, but evaluation of some of the diagnostic criteria by a single physician is difficult and time-consuming. A Marfan clinic was established at the University of Tokyo Hospital in 2005, together with cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, pediatricians, orthopedists, and ophthalmologists in one place, for the purpose of speedy and accurate evaluation and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.

RECENT FINDINGS: Sophisticated genetic techniques are able to detect mosaicism in one-third of individuals previously thought to have monosomy X. Prenatal detection using maternal blood should permit noninvasive detection of most fetuses with an X chromosome abnormality. Disproportionate growth with short limbs has been documented in this condition, and a target gene of short stature homeobox, connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), has been described. Liver disease is more common in Turner syndrome than previously recognized. Most girls have gonadal failure. Spontaneous puberty and menarche is more commonly seen in girls with XX mosaicism. Low-dose estrogen replacement therapy may be given early to induce a more normal onset and tempo of puberty. Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction carries a substantial risk, particularly if the woman has known cardiac or aortic disease. Neurodevelopmental differences in Turner syndrome are beginning to be correlated with differences in brain anatomy. SUMMARY: An increased understanding of the molecular basis for aspects of this disorder is now developing. In addition, a renewed focus on health maintenance through the life span should provide better general and targeted healthcare for these girls and women.\n25517026\t0\t15\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n25517026\t183\t198\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n25517026\t430\t437\tfetuses\tSpecies\t10090\n25517026\t446\t470\tX chromosome abnormality\tDisease\tMESH:D002869\n25517026\t597\t628\tconnective tissue growth factor\tGene\t1490\n25517026\t630\t634\tCtgf\tGene\t1490\n25517026\t657\t670\tLiver disease\tDisease\tMESH:D008107\n25517026\t689\t704\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n25517026\t738\t743\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n25517026\t766\t785\tSpontaneous puberty\tDisease\tMESH:D011628\n25517026\t824\t829\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n25517026\t858\t866\testrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n25517026\t1048\t1053\twoman\tSpecies\t9606\n25517026\t1064\t1089\tcardiac or aortic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D006331\n25517026\t1125\t1140\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n25517026\t1451\t1456\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n25517026\t1461\t1466\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'25533182|t|Turner syndrome--issues to consider for transition to adulthood.\n25533182|a|BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with a spectrum of health problems across the age span, which requires particular attention during the transition period in these adolescents. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The majority of girls with TS require oestrogen replacement from puberty onwards, which is important for adequate feminization, uterine development and maintenance of bone health. There is a lifetime increased risk from autoimmune conditions like hypothyroidism, coeliac disease, hearing loss and aortic dilatation with the potential to lead to aortic dissection. A systematic and holistic approach to provision of health care in TS is needed. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Several unanswered questions remain, including the choice of hormone replacement therapy in the young person with TS and in adulthood; the optimal mode of cardiovascular assessment; the best management and assessment prior to and during pregnancy. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: The optimal model of care and transition to adult services in TS requires attention.

This is mostly due to a dearth of clinical studies performed in pediatric patients. In Marfan syndrome, the major sources of morbidity and mortality relate to the cardiovascular system. In this review, we focus on aortic involvement seen in pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome, ranging from aortic dilatation to aortic rupture and heart failure. We discuss the histological, morphological, and pathogenetic basis of the cardiac manifestations seen in pediatric Marfan syndrome and use a specific case to depict our experienced range of cardiovascular manifestations. The survival for patients with Marfan syndrome may approach the expected survival for non-affected patients, with optimal management.

The predisposition of patients with Lynch syndrome to urological cancer, particularly upper tract urothelial carcinoma, is underappreciated. Urologists may be involved in several aspects of care involving Lynch syndrome, including identifying undiagnosed patients, surveillance of those with established Lynch syndrome or screening family members, in addition to treating patients with Lynch syndrome in whom upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops. We sought to increase awareness in the urological community about Lynch syndrome and provide some guidance where little currently exists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement we reviewed the available published literature and guidelines from 1998 to 2014 on Lynch syndrome and its association with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Recommendations based on the literature and the consensus of expert opinion are provided. RESULTS: No randomized or prospective study has been done to evaluate Lynch syndrome in the setting of urological cancer. All data were based on retrospective studies. Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by germline mutations in 4 mismatch repair genes, leading to the accumulation of DNA errors in microsatellite regions. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma develops in up to 28% of patients with known Lynch syndrome. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is established by clinical criteria, tumor tissue testing and genetic evaluation. Urologists should suspect Lynch syndrome when a patient with upper tract urothelial carcinoma presents before age 60 years or meets the 3-2-1 rule. Screening patients with Lynch syndrome for upper tract urothelial carcinoma presents a particular challenge. While no ideal screening test exists, at a minimum routine urinalysis is recommended using the American Urological Association guideline of 3 or more red blood cells per high power field as a trigger for further assessment. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma associated with Lynch syndrome presents at a younger age than sporadic upper tract urothelial carcinoma. It shows a higher proportion of ureteral cancer with a female preponderance and a possible predisposition to bilaterality. CONCLUSIONS: Lynch syndrome is a common genetic disease that is an underappreciated cause of upper tract urothelial carcinoma and possibly other urological cancers. Optimal screening for upper tract urothelial carcinoma in this population is unclear. Further study is needed to identify the best screening test and interval of testing. Urologists should consider routine tissue testing of de novo upper tract urothelial carcinoma tissue in individuals at risk.\n25711197\t76\t90\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t106\t147\thereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t161\t176\tgenetic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n25711197\t200\t208\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n25711197\t214\t228\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t243\t249\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n25711197\t264\t296\tupper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t383\t397\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t433\t441\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n25711197\t482\t496\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t550\t558\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n25711197\t564\t578\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t599\t619\turothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D014523\n25711197\t696\t710\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t970\t984\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t1010\t1042\tupper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t1204\t1218\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t1248\t1254\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n25711197\t1302\t1316\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t1323\t1357\tautosomal dominant genetic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n25711197\t1484\t1516\tUpper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t1542\t1550\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n25711197\t1562\t1576\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t1595\t1609\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t1647\t1652\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n25711197\t1718\t1732\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t1740\t1747\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n25711197\t1753\t1785\tupper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t1850\t1858\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n25711197\t1864\t1878\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t1883\t1915\tupper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t2173\t2205\tUpper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t2222\t2236\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t2268\t2309\tsporadic upper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t2343\t2358\tureteral cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D014516\n25711197\t2447\t2461\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n25711197\t2474\t2489\tgenetic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n25711197\t2527\t2559\tupper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t2590\t2597\tcancers\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n25711197\t2621\t2653\tupper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n25711197\t2831\t2863\tupper tract urothelial carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D012141\n\n'b"25754283|t|Aortopathies in Turner syndrome -- new strategies for evaluation and treatment.\n25754283|a|Turner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder which impairs women's growth, reproductive function, cardiovascular development and other functions. This syndrome has been proposed as an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease. Despite this, life-threatening cardiovascular outcomes affecting young women are dismissed because of incomplete follow up. During assessment due to their smaller stature, it should be noted that, although the ascending aorta diameter is normal in absolute terms, after indexation for body size, patients with Turner syndrome may have a dilated aorta.Based on recent guidelines and the latest studies, there is new evidence on the use of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing aortic lesions. New management possibilities of aortopathies have also been discussed. This approach should optimise medical care for women with Turner syndrome, but many areas of uncertainty still remain in the diagnosis and management of this syndrome, and new prospective studies are needed.\n25754283\t0\t12\tAortopathies\tDisease\t\n25754283\t16\t31\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n25754283\t80\t95\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n25754283\t106\t122\tgenetic disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n25754283\t137\t142\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n25754283\t290\t312\tcardiovascular disease\tDisease\tMESH:D002318\n25754283\t385\t390\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n25754283\t610\t618\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n25754283\t624\t639\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n25754283\t793\t807\taortic lesions\tDisease\tMESH:D001018\n25754283\t841\t853\taortopathies\tDisease\t\n25754283\t927\t932\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n25754283\t938\t953\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n\n"b'25911666|t|Marfan syndrome, inherited aortopathies and exercise: what is the right answer?\n25911666|a|Exercise recommendations for those who have Marfan syndrome or other genetic predisposition for thoracic aortic disease remain controversial and at times ambiguous.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study of the diagnosis, course, and current status of patients with Turner syndrome followed up at our section over the past 40 years, based on review of medical records supplemented with a telephone survey. RESULTS: Forty-five female patients with a current mean age of 22.95years (range 2-38) and a mean age at diagnosis of 4.71 were included. Sixty-three percent of them showed a mosaic karyotype. Short stature was the most common reason for consultation (54%), with increased prenatal diagnosis in most recent cases. Seventy-two percent have been treated with growth hormone, together with oxandrolone in 26%. Final stature was short in 69% of patients. Gonadal failure was found in 66%; most of whom received replacement therapy. Three patients achieved pregnancy by oocyte donation. The 31 adult patients are mainly monitored by the endocrinology (37.5%) and/or gynecology (34.4%) departments. As regards psychosocial aspects, 22% required support during school, and 80% completed middle to high level education. Two patients died, one due to dissecting aortic aneurysm and the other one, who had multiple pathological conditions, from respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Short stature is the main cause of diagnosis in patients with Turner syndrome; most cases show genetic mosaicism. The most common clinical manifestations include short stature and gonadal failure. Eighty percent of patients complete middle or high education. In adulthood, follow-up is irregular, sometimes scarce, and clearly improvable.\n26298398\t0\t15\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26298398\t54\t69\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26298398\t188\t196\tPATIENTS\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t293\t301\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t307\t322\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26298398\t474\t482\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t804\t818\tgrowth hormone\tGene\t2688\n26298398\t834\t845\toxandrolone\tChemical\tMESH:D010074\n26298398\t888\t896\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t898\t913\tGonadal failure\tDisease\tMESH:D006058\n26298398\t981\t989\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t1042\t1050\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t1263\t1271\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t1300\t1315\taortic aneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D001014\n26298398\t1382\t1401\trespiratory failure\tDisease\tMESH:D012131\n26298398\t1464\t1472\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26298398\t1478\t1493\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26298398\t1578\t1611\tshort stature and gonadal failure\tDisease\tMESH:D006058\n26298398\t1631\t1639\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'26306841|t|Marfan Syndrome and Related Heritable Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections.\n26306841|a|In this overview we aim to address a number of recent insights and developments regarding clinical aspects, etiology, and treatment of Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease (H-TAD).

Broadly, HNPCC may be dichotomized into conditions that demonstrate defective DNA MMR and microsatellite instability (MSI) vs those conditions that demonstrate intact DNA MMR. Conditions characterized by MMR deficient CRCs include Lynch syndrome (germline MMR mutation), Lynch-like syndrome (biallelic somatic MMR mutations), constitutional MMR deficiency syndrome (biallelic germline MMR mutations), and sporadic MSI CRC (somatic biallelic methylation of MLH1). HNPCC conditions with intact DNA MMR associated with familial CRC include polymerase proofreading associated polyposis and familial colorectal cancer type X. Although next generation sequencing technologies have elucidated the genetic cause for some HNPCC conditions, others remain genetically undefined. Differentiating between Lynch syndrome and the other HNPCC disorders has profound implications for cancer risk assessment and surveillance of affected patients and their at-risk relatives. Clinical suspicion coupled with molecular tumor analysis and testing for germline mutations can help differentiate the clinical mimicry within HNPCC and facilitate diagnosis and management.\n26309352\t0\t14\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t19\t33\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t75\t98\thereditary colon cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n26309352\t111\t142\tnon-polyposis colorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n26309352\t144\t149\tHNPCC\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t182\t196\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t333\t347\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t386\t412\tfamilial colorectal cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n26309352\t414\t417\tCRC\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n26309352\t429\t434\tHNPCC\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t624\t642\tMMR deficient CRCs\tDisease\tMESH:C536928\n26309352\t651\t665\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t761\t784\tMMR deficiency syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:C536928\n26309352\t876\t880\tMLH1\tGene\t4292\n26309352\t883\t888\tHNPCC\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t936\t948\tfamilial CRC\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n26309352\t992\t1001\tpolyposis\tDisease\tMESH:D044483\n26309352\t1006\t1039\tfamilial colorectal cancer type X\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n26309352\t1133\t1149\tHNPCC conditions\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t1212\t1226\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t1241\t1256\tHNPCC disorders\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n26309352\t1287\t1293\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n26309352\t1339\t1347\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26309352\t1419\t1424\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n26309352\t1520\t1525\tHNPCC\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n\n'b'26323199|t|Turner Syndrome in Girls Presenting with Coarctation of the Aorta.\n26323199|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of Turner syndrome in a population-based, statewide cohort of girls with coarctation of the aorta. STUDY DESIGN: The Utah Birth Defects Network was used to ascertain a cohort of girls between 1997 and 2011 with coarctation of the aorta. Livebirths with isolated coarctation of the aorta or transverse arch hypoplasia were included and patients with complex congenital heart disease not usually seen in Turner syndrome were excluded. RESULTS: Of 244 girls with coarctation of the aorta, 77 patients were excluded, leaving a cohort of 167 girls; 86 patients (51%) had chromosomal studies and 21 (12.6%) were diagnosed with Turner syndrome. All patients were diagnosed within the first 4 months of life and 5 (24%) were diagnosed prenatally. Fifteen patients (71%) had Turner syndrome-related findings in addition to coarctation of the aorta. Girls with mosaicism were less likely to have Turner syndrome-associated findings (3/6 mosaic girls compared with 12/17 girls with non-mosaic 45,X). Twelve girls (57%) diagnosed with Turner syndrome also had a bicommissural aortic valve. CONCLUSION: At least 12.6% of girls born with coarctation of the aorta have karyotype-confirmed Turner syndrome. Such a high frequency, combined with the clinical benefits of an early diagnosis, supports genetic screening for Turner syndrome in girls presenting with coarctation of the aorta.\n26323199\t19\t24\tGirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t41\t65\tCoarctation of the Aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n26323199\t107\t122\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26323199\t166\t171\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t177\t201\tcoarctation of the aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n26323199\t282\t287\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t315\t339\tcoarctation of the aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n26323199\t366\t390\tcoarctation of the aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n26323199\t405\t420\tarch hypoplasia\tDisease\tMESH:D001015\n26323199\t439\t447\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t461\t485\tcongenital heart disease\tDisease\tMESH:D006331\n26323199\t506\t521\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26323199\t553\t558\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t564\t588\tcoarctation of the aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n26323199\t593\t601\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t641\t646\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t651\t659\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t725\t740\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26323199\t746\t754\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t851\t859\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t918\t942\tcoarctation of the aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n26323199\t944\t949\tGirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t990\t1005\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26323199\t1038\t1043\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t1064\t1069\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t1100\t1105\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t1127\t1142\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26323199\t1212\t1217\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t1228\t1252\tcoarctation of the aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n26323199\t1278\t1293\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26323199\t1408\t1423\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26323199\t1427\t1432\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n26323199\t1449\t1473\tcoarctation of the aorta\tDisease\tMESH:D001017\n\n'b'26350976|t|The risk for type B aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome.\n26350976|a|Marfan syndrome is the most prevalent connective tissue disorder, with an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance.

Although these studies have revealed much about the math deficits common to Turner syndrome, their diversity makes comparisons between individual studies difficult. As a result, the consistency of outcomes among these diverse measures remains unknown. The overarching aim of this review is to provide a systematic meta-analysis of the differences in math and number performance between females with Turner syndrome and age-matched neurotypical peers. METHOD: We provide a meta-analysis of behavioral performance in Turner syndrome relative to age-matched neurotypical populations on assessments of math and number aptitude. In total, 112 comparisons collected across 17 studies were included. RESULTS: Although 54% of all statistical comparisons in our analyses failed to reject the null hypothesis, our results indicate that meaningful group differences exist on all comparisons except those that do not require explicit calculation. INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these results help elucidate our current understanding of math and number weaknesses in Turner syndrome, while highlighting specific topics that require further investigation.\n26566693\t39\t54\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26566693\t108\t123\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26566693\t128\t152\tmath learning disability\tDisease\tMESH:D007859\n26566693\t304\t317\tmath deficits\tDisease\tMESH:D009461\n26566693\t328\t343\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26566693\t651\t666\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26566693\t767\t782\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n26566693\t1307\t1322\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n\n'b'26607862|t|Systematic review of chronic pain in persons with Marfan syndrome.\n26607862|a|The purpose of this study was to explore the literature on chronic pain in adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS), critically appraising and synthesizing relevant literature. A systematic review was conducted by searching the published literature databases using available medical, physical, psychological, social databases and other sources. All studies that addressed pain in MFS, published in peer-reviewed journals were assessed. Of 351 search results, 18 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. All studies were cross-sectional and quantitative; no randomized controlled trials or intervention studies were found. Most studies had small sample sizes, low response rates and mainly dealt with other aspects of the diagnosis than pain. Only one article dealt mainly with pain. The research on chronic pain in MFS is limited in size and quality. Despite these limitations, studies describe that the prevalence of pain in patients with MFS is high, varying from 47 to 92% and affecting several anatomic sites. In addition, chronic pain limits daily function and few studies describe treatment options for pain in patients with MFS. Research is needed to obtain more evidence-based knowledge for developing more appropriate rehabilitation programs for people with MFS.\n26607862\t21\t33\tchronic pain\tDisease\tMESH:D059350\n26607862\t37\t44\tpersons\tSpecies\t9606\n26607862\t50\t65\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n26607862\t134\t138\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t154\t169\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n26607862\t171\t174\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n26607862\t432\t436\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t440\t443\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n26607862\t800\t804\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t841\t845\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t871\t875\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t879\t882\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n26607862\t982\t986\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t990\t998\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26607862\t1004\t1007\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n26607862\t1099\t1103\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t1173\t1177\tpain\tDisease\tMESH:D010146\n26607862\t1181\t1189\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n26607862\t1195\t1198\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n26607862\t1319\t1325\tpeople\tSpecies\t9606\n26607862\t1331\t1334\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n\n'b'26642845|t|Tumor islands and spread through air spaces: Distinct patterns of invasion in lung adenocarcinoma.\n26642845|a|Lung adenocarcinoma is a highly heterogeneous disease and the heterogeneity is associated with various patient outcomes even in early-stage tumors. In order to improve prognostic and predictive values, the IASLC/ATS/ERS international multidisciplinary lung adenocarcinoma classification was put forth in 2011 and it has been adopted in the recently published World Health Organization (WHO) classification of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart 4th edition 2015, and lung adenocarcinomas are classified based on the predominant pattern. The performance of the classification in stratifying patient outcomes after resection of Stage I tumors and predicting molecular alterations has been confirmed by several studies. It also includes the category of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) that predicts 100% 5-year recurrence free survival after curative resection similar to adenocarcinoma in situ. The diagnosis of MIA is based on not only size of the invasive component but also the absence of aggressive morphologic features such as pleural and/or lymphovascular invasion. Importantly, the WHO 2015 classification has introduced the concept of air space invasion and includes it as the exclusion criteria for MIA. The air space invasion consists of tumor islands and spread through air spaces (STAS).

Clinical testing of tumor tissues for the presence of MMR gene deficiency is standard practice in clinical oncology, with immunohistochemistry and PCR-based microsatellite instability analysis used as screening tests to identify potential Lynch syndrome families. The ultimate diagnosis of Lynch syndrome requires documentation of mutation within one of the four MMR genes (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6) or EPCAM, currently achieved by comprehensive sequencing analysis of germline DNA.

This study aimed at characterizing microelastic properties of the ascending aortic wall and lung parenchyma tissues from wild type (WT) and age-matched Fbn1 hypomorphic mice (Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice) to identify tissue-specific biomechanical effects of aging and disease in MFS. Atomic force microscopy was used to indent lung parenchyma and aortic wall tissues, using Hybrid Eshelby Decomposition analysis to extract layer-specific properties of the intima and media. The intima stiffened with age and was not different between WT and Fbn1(mgR/mgR) tissues, whereas the media layer of MFS aortas showed progressive structural and mechanical degradation with a modulus that was 50% softer than WT by 3.5\xc2\xa0months of age. Similarly, MFS mice displayed progressive structural and mechanical deterioration of lung tissue, which was over 85% softer than WT by 3.5\xc2\xa0months of age. Chronic treatment with the angiotensin type I receptor antagonist, losartan, attenuated the aorta and lung tissue degradation, resulting in structural and mechanical properties not significantly different from age-matched WT controls. By revealing micromechanical softening of elastin-rich aorta and lung tissues with disease progression in fibrillin-1 deficient mice, our findings support the use of losartan as a prophylactic treatment that may abrogate the life-threatening symptoms of MFS.\n27090893\t0\t8\tLosartan\tChemical\tMESH:D019808\n27090893\t77\t82\tMouse\tSpecies\t10090\n27090893\t133\t136\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n27090893\t220\t231\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t14118\n27090893\t238\t242\tFBN1\tGene\t14118\n27090893\t397\t401\tFbn1\tGene\t14118\n27090893\t414\t418\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n27090893\t420\t424\tFbn1\tGene\t14118\n27090893\t434\t438\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n27090893\t514\t517\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n27090893\t776\t780\tFbn1\tGene\t14118\n27090893\t974\t978\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n27090893\t1180\t1188\tlosartan\tChemical\tMESH:D019808\n27090893\t1454\t1465\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t14118\n27090893\t1476\t1480\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n27090893\t1514\t1522\tlosartan\tChemical\tMESH:D019808\n27090893\t1602\t1605\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n\n'b'27181042|t|Pathophysiology and Management of Cardiovascular Manifestations in Marfan and Loeys-Dietz Syndromes.\n27181042|a|Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of connective tissue that affects the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular, pulmonary, and nervous systems and is usually caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1. MFS is traditionally considered to result from the structural weakness of connective tissue. However, recent investigations on molecular mechanisms indicate that increased transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2 (TGF-\xce\xb2) activity plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MFS and related disorders, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), which is caused by mutation in TGF-\xce\xb2 signaling-related genes. In addition, recent studies show that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling enhances cardiovascular pathologies in MFS, and the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan has the potential to inhibit aortic aneurysm formation. However, the relationship between TGF-\xce\xb2 and AT1R signaling pathways remains poorly characterized.

Case report and review.\n27343792|a|BACKGROUND: Marfan's Syndrome (MFS) is a disorder of connective tissue, mainly involving the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems. The most severe problems include aortic root dilatation and dissection. Anesthetic management is vital for the improvement on perioperative morbidity. CASE REPORT: 61-year-old male with MFS, presenting mainly with pectus carinatum, scoliosis, ectopia lens, previous spontaneous pneumothorax and aortal aneurysm and dissection submitted to thoracoabdominal aortic prosthesis placement. Underwent routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to lithiasis. Important findings on preoperative examination were thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, metallic murmur on cardiac exam. Chest radiograph revealed Cobb angle of 70\xc2\xb0. Echocardiogram showed evidence of aortic mechanical prosthesis with no deficits. DISCUSSION: Preoperative evaluation should focus on cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The anesthesiologist should be prepared for a potentially difficult intubation. Proper positioning and limb support prior to induction is crucial in order to avoid joint injuries. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis. The patient should be carefully positioned to avoid joint injuries. Intraoperatively cardiovascular monitoring is mandatory: avoid maneuvers that can lead to tachycardia or hypertension, control airway pressure to prevent pneumothorax and maintain an adequate volemia to decrease chances of prolapse, especially if considering laparoscopic surgery. No single intraoperative anesthetic agent or technique has demonstrated superiority. Adequate postoperative pain management is vitally important to avoid the detrimental effects of hypertension and tachycardia.\n27343792\t119\t122\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n27343792\t197\t212\tmusculoskeletal\tDisease\tMESH:D009140\n27343792\t410\t414\tmale\tSpecies\t9606\n27343792\t420\t423\tMFS\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n27343792\t466\t475\tscoliosis\tDisease\tMESH:D012600\n27343792\t477\t489\tectopia lens\tDisease\tMESH:D007905\n27343792\t536\t544\taneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D000783\n27343792\t673\t682\tlithiasis\tDisease\tMESH:D020347\n27343792\t750\t764\tkyphoscoliosis\tDisease\tMESH:C565711\n27343792\t977\t1006\tcardiopulmonary abnormalities\tDisease\tMESH:D006323\n27343792\t1172\t1186\tjoint injuries\tDisease\tMESH:D007592\n27343792\t1233\t1255\tbacterial endocarditis\tDisease\tMESH:D004697\n27343792\t1261\t1268\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n27343792\t1309\t1323\tjoint injuries\tDisease\tMESH:D007592\n27343792\t1415\t1426\ttachycardia\tDisease\tMESH:D013610\n27343792\t1430\t1442\thypertension\tDisease\tMESH:D006973\n27343792\t1517\t1524\tvolemia\tDisease\t\n27343792\t1700\t1718\tpostoperative pain\tDisease\tMESH:D010149\n27343792\t1787\t1799\thypertension\tDisease\tMESH:D006973\n27343792\t1804\t1815\ttachycardia\tDisease\tMESH:D013610\n\n"b'27496117|t|Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal Version 1.2016, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.\n27496117|a|This is a focused update highlighting the most current NCCN Guidelines for diagnosis and management of Lynch syndrome.

Pregnancies in women with TS, conceived with either autologous or donated oocytes, are considered high risk because of the associated miscarriages and life-threatening cardiovascular complications (aortic dissection, severe hypertension). Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a full preconception evaluation and counselling that includes cardiac assessment with Holter blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography, and thoracic MRI. Abnormal findings, such an aortic dilatation, mandate close monitoring throughout the pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period and could possibly contraindicate pregnancy.

Areas covered: Present research suggests that there may be a link between treatment pattern, disease progression and economic costs of Marfan syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the disease and preventive interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective, it may reduce the amount of emergency surgery or intervention, and inpatient stays. In addition, it slows disease progression, lowers lifestyle restrictions, reduces psychological stress, and improves health-related quality of life. Expert commentary: Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual aim by simultaneously containing costs and reducing the number and length of inpatient stays.\n27662508\t36\t51\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n27662508\t93\t112\tmultisystem disease\tDisease\tMESH:D004194\n27662508\t236\t244\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27662508\t378\t386\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27662508\t523\t538\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n27662508\t648\t655\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'27724990|t|Identification of FBN1 gene mutations in Ukrainian Marfan syndrome patients.\n27724990|a|Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder, predominantly affecting the ocular, skeletal and cardiovascular systems.

However, cryptic Y chromosome material is suggested to be a risk factor for gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Here, we aimed to estimate the frequency of cryptic Y chromosome material in patients with Turner syndrome and determine whether Y chromosome material increased the risk for development of gonadoblastoma. A total of 124 patients who were diagnosed with Turner syndrome by conventional cytogenetic techniques underwent additional molecular analysis to detect cryptic Y chromosome material. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome harboring Y chromosome cell lines had their ovaries removed prophylactically. Finally, we assessed the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in patients with Turner syndrome. Molecular analysis demonstrated that 10 patients had Y chromosome material among 118 patients without overt Y chromosome (8.5%). Six patients with overt Y chromosome and four patients with cryptic Y chromosome material underwent oophorectomy. Histopathological analysis revealed that the occurrence of gonadoblastoma in the total group was 2.4%, and gonadoblastoma occurred in one of six patients with an overt Y chromosome (16.7%) and 2 of 10 patients with cryptic Y chromosome material (20.0%). The risk of developing gonadoblastoma in patients with cryptic Y chromosome material was similar to that in patients with overt Y chromosome. Therefore, molecular screening for Y chromosome material should be recommended for all patients with Turner syndrome to detect individuals at a high risk of gonadoblastoma and to facilitate proper management of the disease.\n28349385\t8\t22\tGonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t38\t46\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t52\t67\tTurner Syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t200\t208\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t214\t229\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t343\t357\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t435\t449\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t453\t461\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t467\t482\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t561\t569\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t575\t590\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t673\t687\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t704\t712\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t737\t752\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t886\t894\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t900\t915\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t960\t967\tovaries\tDisease\tMESH:D010051\n28349385\t1033\t1047\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t1051\t1059\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1065\t1080\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t1122\t1130\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1167\t1175\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1215\t1223\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1257\t1265\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1384\t1398\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t1432\t1446\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t1470\t1478\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1526\t1534\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1602\t1616\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n28349385\t1620\t1628\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1687\t1695\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1808\t1816\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28349385\t1822\t1837\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28349385\t1878\t1892\tgonadoblastoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018238\n\n'b'28383843|t|[Marfan syndrome in childhood and adolescence].\n28383843|a|The Marfan syndrome is a systemic connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. A mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene, a glycoprotein which is the main constituent of the extracellular matrix, is the cause of the disease. The cardinal features involve the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems. The expression of the Marfan syndrome varies from the severe neonatal presentation to the classical manifestations of the child and young adult, but also comprises isolated features. In children, phenotypical manifestations are age dependent. For these reasons, the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome might be lately revealed by its cardiovascular complications. We report the case of 2 siblings: it illustrates the phenotypic variability that might be observed in a same family, the phenotype evolution with age and the diagnosis challenge in childhood.\n28383843\t52\t67\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28383843\t164\t175\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t2200\n28383843\t486\t491\tchild\tSpecies\t9606\n28383843\t550\t558\tchildren\tSpecies\t9606\n28383843\t643\t658\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n\n'b'28385916|t|Mild aerobic exercise blocks elastin fiber fragmentation and aortic dilatation in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome associated aortic aneurysm.\n28385916|a|Regular low-impact physical activity is generally allowed in patients with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. However, being above average in height encourages young adults with this syndrome to engage in high-intensity contact sports, which unfortunately increases the risk for aortic aneurysm and rupture, the leading cause of death in Marfan syndrome. In this study, we investigated the effects of voluntary (cage-wheel) or forced (treadmill) aerobic exercise at different intensities on aortic function and structure in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. Four-week-old Marfan and wild-type mice were subjected to voluntary and forced exercise regimens or sedentary lifestyle for 5 mo. Thoracic aortic tissue was isolated and subjected to structural and functional studies. Our data showed that exercise improved aortic wall structure and function in Marfan mice and that the beneficial effect was biphasic, with an optimum at low intensity exercise (55-65% V\xcc\x87o2max) and tapering off at a higher intensity of exercise (85% V\xcc\x87o2max). The mechanism underlying the reduced elastin fragmentation in Marfan mice involved reduction of the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 within the aortic wall. These findings present the first evidence of potential beneficial effects of mild exercise on the structural integrity of the aortic wall in Marfan syndrome associated aneurysm. Our finding that moderate, but not strenuous, exercise protects aortic structure and function in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome could have important implications for the medical care of young Marfan patients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study provides conclusive scientific evidence that daily exercise can improve aortic health in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome associated aortic aneurysm, and it establishes the threshold for the exercise intensity beyond which exercise may not be as protective. These findings establish a platform for a new focus on promoting regular exercise in Marfan patients at an optimum intensity and create a paradigm shift in clinical care of Marfan patients suffering from aortic aneurysm complications.\n28385916\t29\t36\telastin\tGene\t13717\n28385916\t84\t89\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n28385916\t99\t114\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28385916\t126\t141\taortic aneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D001014\n28385916\t204\t212\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28385916\t218\t233\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28385916\t248\t263\ttissue disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D059226\n28385916\t304\t315\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t2200\n28385916\t491\t506\taortic aneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D001014\n28385916\t511\t518\trupture\tDisease\tMESH:D012421\n28385916\t541\t546\tdeath\tDisease\tMESH:D003643\n28385916\t550\t565\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28385916\t738\t743\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n28385916\t753\t768\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28385916\t805\t809\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n28385916\t1072\t1076\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n28385916\t1284\t1291\telastin\tGene\t13717\n28385916\t1316\t1320\tmice\tSpecies\t10090\n28385916\t1361\t1394\tmatrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9\tGene\t17390;17395\n28385916\t1560\t1575\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28385916\t1587\t1595\taneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D000783\n28385916\t1696\t1701\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n28385916\t1711\t1726\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28385916\t1798\t1806\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28385916\t1933\t1938\tmouse\tSpecies\t10090\n28385916\t1948\t1963\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28385916\t1975\t1990\taortic aneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D001014\n28385916\t2192\t2200\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28385916\t2280\t2288\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28385916\t2304\t2333\taortic aneurysm complications\tDisease\tMESH:D001014\n\n'b"28403077|t|High expression of CD8 predicts favorable prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma: A cohort study.\n28403077|a|Lung carcinoma is the most common cause of malignant death worldwide. CD8 T cells, as critical elements in antitumor immunity, could function as good prognostic indicators in various kinds of cancers such as renal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, but its prognostic role in lung adenocarcinoma is still unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the prognostic role of CD8 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.Paired tumor and adjacent noncancerous tissues were obtained from 102 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and CD8 expression of these samples was examined by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the relationships between the expression of CD8 and pathological grade, TNM stage, clinical stage, as well as overall survival (OS).Expression of CD8 was significantly increased in lung adenocarcinoma compared with that in adjacent lung adenocarcinoma (P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001). CD8 expression was negatively correlated with pathological grade (r = -0.216, P = .022) and N stage (r = -0.372, P\xe2\x80\x8a<\xe2\x80\x8a.001), while no statistical correlation with T stage, or clinical stage. Importantly, OS was numerically increased in patients with high expression of CD8 than the group of intermediate and low CD8 expression (P = .12). Furthermore, CD8 could significantly increase OS (P = .043, HR: .713, 95%CI: .515-.989) by univariate Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis.Our data indicated that expression of CD8, as a protective factor, is correlated with the outcome of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

We hypothesize that this de novo novel missense FBN1 mutation disrupts fibrillin-1 function and is probably involved in the development of Marfan syndrome in this patient.\n28442527\t8\t19\tFibrillin-1\tGene\t2200\n28442527\t73\t77\tGirl\tSpecies\t9606\n28442527\t101\t136\tautosomal dominant genetic disorder\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n28442527\t191\t195\tgirl\tSpecies\t9606\n28442527\t376\t395\tjoint hypermobility\tDisease\tMESH:D007593\n28442527\t621\t631\tc.2810G >A\tDNAMutation\tc.2810G>A;RS#:113602180\n28442527\t649\t653\tFBN1\tGene\t2200\n28442527\t666\t673\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28442527\t690\t697\tparents\tSpecies\t9606\n28442527\t776\t787\trs113602180\tSNP\trs113602180\n28442527\t856\t871\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28442527\t921\t925\tFBN1\tGene\t2200\n28442527\t944\t955\tfibrillin-1\tGene\t2200\n28442527\t1012\t1027\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28442527\t1036\t1043\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n\n'b'28456931|t|Thyroid Autoimmunity in Girls with Turner Syndrome.\n28456931|a|Turner syndrome is associated with increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, especially those of the thyroid gland. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity among pediatric patients with Turner syndrome. The study was retrospective and included 41 girls with Turner syndrome aged 6-18 years. Free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO-Ab) antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin (TG-Ab) antibodies, and karyotype were investigated. The correlation between karyotype and incidence of thyroid autoimmunity was also examined. Eleven patients (26.8%) were positive for TPO-Ab and/or TG-Ab. Three girls from that subgroup were euthyroid, 5 had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 3 were diagnosed with overt hypothyroidism. Out of these 11 patients affected by thyroid autoimmunity, 6 girls had mosaic karyotype with X-isochromosome (n = 4) or with deletions (n = 2), and 5 had the 45,X karyotype. The study findings confirmed a high incidence of thyroid autoimmunity in girls with Turner syndrome, but we failed to observe an association between the incidence of thyroid autoimmunity and karyotype. We conclude that it is important to monitor thyroid function in patients with Turner syndrome because they are prone to develop hypothyroidism.\n28456931\t24\t29\tGirls\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t35\t50\tTurner Syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28456931\t52\t67\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28456931\t110\t129\tautoimmune diseases\tDisease\tMESH:D001327\n28456931\t224\t244\tthyroid autoimmunity\tDisease\tMESH:D013967\n28456931\t261\t269\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t275\t290\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28456931\t336\t341\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t347\t362\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28456931\t385\t394\tthyroxine\tChemical\tMESH:D013974\n28456931\t605\t625\tthyroid autoimmunity\tDisease\tMESH:D013967\n28456931\t652\t660\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t714\t719\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t773\t787\thypothyroidism\tDisease\tMESH:D007037\n28456931\t821\t835\thypothyroidism\tDisease\tMESH:D007037\n28456931\t853\t861\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t874\t894\tthyroid autoimmunity\tDisease\tMESH:D013967\n28456931\t898\t903\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t1060\t1080\tthyroid autoimmunity\tDisease\tMESH:D013967\n28456931\t1084\t1089\tgirls\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t1095\t1110\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28456931\t1177\t1197\tthyroid autoimmunity\tDisease\tMESH:D013967\n28456931\t1277\t1285\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28456931\t1291\t1306\tTurner syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D014424\n28456931\t1341\t1355\thypothyroidism\tDisease\tMESH:D007037\n\n'b'28580713|t|Mitral valve prolapse and Marfan syndrome.\n28580713|a|Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic genetic condition affecting connective tissue.

METHODS: Total proteins of A549 and 16HBE mitochondria were extracted through 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The differential mitochondria proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and were further confirmed by Western blot, immunoelectron microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in A549 cells as well as lung adenocarcinoma tissues. RESULTS: A total of 41 differentially expressed protein spots were found in A549 mitochondria. Of them, 15 proteins were highly expressed and 26 proteins were lowly expressed in the mitochondria of A549 (by more than 1.5 times). Among the 15 more highly expressed proteins, AAA-TOB3 (by more than 3 times) was highly expressed in the mitochondria of A549 compared with the 16HBE, by LC-MS/MS identification. High electron density and clear circular colloidal gold-marked AAA-TOB3 particles were observed in the A549 cells via immunoelectron microscopy. Besides, AAA-TOB3 was confirmed to be elevated in lung adenocarcinoma by Western blot and IHC. Moreover, increased AAA-TOB3 correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of lung adenocarcinoma (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AAA-TOB3 was highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma, and the up-regulation of AAA-TOB3 correlated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of lung adenocarcinoma, which suggested that it could serve as a potential molecular marker for lung adenocarcinoma.\n28623644\t10\t18\tAAA-TOB3\tGene\t83858\n28623644\t79\t98\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28623644\t196\t201\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n28623644\t202\t221\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28623644\t282\t294\tcarcinogenic\tDisease\tMESH:D063646\n28623644\t342\t347\t16HBE\tCellLine\tCVCL:0112\n28623644\t387\t401\tpolyacrylamide\tChemical\tMESH:C040388\n28623644\t672\t691\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28623644\t975\t983\tAAA-TOB3\tGene\t83858\n28623644\t1074\t1079\t16HBE\tCellLine\tCVCL:0112\n28623644\t1172\t1180\tAAA-TOB3\tGene\t83858\n28623644\t1263\t1271\tAAA-TOB3\tGene\t83858\n28623644\t1304\t1323\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28623644\t1369\t1377\tAAA-TOB3\tGene\t83858\n28623644\t1438\t1457\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28623644\t1481\t1489\tAAA-TOB3\tGene\t83858\n28623644\t1514\t1533\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28623644\t1560\t1568\tAAA-TOB3\tGene\t83858\n28623644\t1629\t1648\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28623644\t1722\t1741\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n\n'b'28627089|t|Analysis of PTPN22, ZFAT and MYO9B polymorphisms in Turner Syndrome and risk of autoimmune disease.\n28627089|a|Turner syndrome (TS) is one of the most common sexual chromosome abnormalities and is clearly associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, particularly thyroid disease and coeliac disease (CD).

Lynch syndrome accounts for up to 3% of all CRC, making it the most common hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome. Germline mutations in methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) genes give rise to microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumor DNA. Lynch syndrome is most frequently caused by pathogrenic variants in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Germline mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 account for approximately 90% of detected mutations in families with Lynch syndrome. Pathogenic vatiants in MSH6 have been reported in approximately 7-10% of families with Lynch syndrome. Pathogenic variants in PMS2 account for fewer than 5% of mutations in families with Lynch syndrome.

Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome, caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. METHODS: Published articles from peer-reviewed journals were obtained from PubMed, Google Scholar and Clinicaltrials.gov . Based on the recent research data, we provide an update on the MSI testing, along with the evolving role of MSI in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of colorectal cancers. RESULTS: Studies have led to significant advances in the molecular pathogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of MSI-H colorectal cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that colorectal cancers with MSI-H show different outcome and treatment response from those with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. Therefore, MSI testing is essential not only in the genetic context, but it may also have important prognostic and predictive value of response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Many experts and professional authorities have recommended a universal MSI testing in all individuals newly diagnosed with colorectal cancers.\n28699072\t75\t93\tColorectal Cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n28699072\t107\t128\tColorectal carcinomas\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n28699072\t177\t180\tMSI\tGene\t5928\n28699072\t207\t225\tcolorectal cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n28699072\t269\t276\tcancers\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n28699072\t293\t307\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n28699072\t323\t373\thereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n28699072\t375\t380\tHNPCC\tDisease\t\n28699072\t383\t397\tLynch syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003123\n28699072\t404\t449\tautosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009386\n28699072\t516\t520\tMLH1\tGene\t4292\n28699072\t522\t526\tMSH2\tGene\t4436\n28699072\t528\t532\tMSH6\tGene\t2956\n28699072\t537\t541\tPMS2\tGene\t5395\n28699072\t729\t732\tMSI\tGene\t5928\n28699072\t774\t777\tMSI\tGene\t5928\n28699072\t819\t837\tcolorectal cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n28699072\t962\t986\tMSI-H colorectal cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n28699072\t1020\t1038\tcolorectal cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n28699072\t1044\t1047\tMSI\tGene\t5928\n28699072\t1140\t1146\ttumors\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n28699072\t1159\t1162\tMSI\tGene\t5928\n28699072\t1411\t1414\tMSI\tGene\t5928\n28699072\t1463\t1481\tcolorectal cancers\tDisease\tMESH:D015179\n\n'b"28716062|t|The effects of acute and elective cardiac surgery on the anxiety traits of patients with Marfan syndrome.\n28716062|a|BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome is a genetic disease, presenting with dysfunction of connective tissues leading to lesions in the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle system. Within these symptoms, the most typical is weakness of the connective tissue in the aorta, manifesting as aortic dilatation (aneurysm). This could, in turn, become annuloaortic ectasia, or life-threatening dissection. As a result, life-saving and preventative cardiac surgical interventions are frequent among Marfan syndrome patients. Aortic aneurysm could turn into annuloaortic ectasia or life-threatening dissection, thus life-saving and preventive cardiac surgical interventions are frequent among patients with Marfan syndrome. We hypothesized that patients with Marfan syndrome have different level of anxiety, depression and satisfaction with life compared to that of the non-clinical patient population. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome were divided into 3 groups: those scheduled for prophylactic surgery, those needing acute surgery, and those without need for surgery (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09, 19, 17, respectively). To examine the psychological features of the patients, Spielberger's anxiety (STAI) test, Beck's Depression questionnaire (BDI), the Berne Questionnaire of Subjective Well-being, and the Satisfaction with Life scale were applied. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in trait anxiety between healthy individuals and patients with Marfan syndrome after acute life-saving surgery (p\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa00.01). The mean score of Marfan syndrome patients was 48.56 (standard deviation (SD): 5.8) as compared to the STAI population mean score of 43.72 (SD: 8.53). No difference was found between groups on the BDI (p\xc2\xa0>\xc2\xa00.1). Finally, a significant, medium size effect was found between patient groups on the Joy in Living scale (F (2.39)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03.51, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.040, \xce\xb7(2)\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa00.15). CONCLUSIONS: Involving psychiatric and mental-health care, in addition to existing surgical treatment interventions, is essential for more successful recovery of patients with Marfan syndrome.\n28716062\t57\t64\tanxiety\tDisease\tMESH:D001008\n28716062\t75\t83\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t89\t104\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t118\t133\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t139\t154\tgenetic disease\tDisease\tMESH:D030342\n28716062\t400\t408\taneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D000783\n28716062\t439\t459\tannuloaortic ectasia\tDisease\tMESH:C562834\n28716062\t585\t600\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t601\t609\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t611\t626\tAortic aneurysm\tDisease\tMESH:D001014\n28716062\t643\t663\tannuloaortic ectasia\tDisease\tMESH:C562834\n28716062\t778\t786\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t792\t807\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t830\t838\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t844\t859\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t884\t891\tanxiety\tDisease\tMESH:D001008\n28716062\t893\t903\tdepression\tDisease\tMESH:D003866\n28716062\t968\t975\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t997\t1005\tPatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t1021\t1036\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t1247\t1255\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t1271\t1278\tanxiety\tDisease\tMESH:D001008\n28716062\t1292\t1309\tBeck's Depression\tDisease\tMESH:D003866\n28716062\t1485\t1492\tanxiety\tDisease\tMESH:D001008\n28716062\t1525\t1533\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t1539\t1554\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t1617\t1632\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n28716062\t1633\t1641\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t1872\t1879\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t1980\t1991\tpsychiatric\tDisease\tMESH:D001523\n28716062\t2119\t2127\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28716062\t2133\t2148\tMarfan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D008382\n\n"b"28720066|t|High expression of SLC34A2 is a favorable prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma patients.\n28720066|a|Dysregulation of SLC34A2 (NaPi2b) in tumors has attracted wide attention, but its expression and function in non-small cell lung cancer remains unclear. By examining its expression in lung adenocarcinoma and correlation to patient outcome, we aimed to explore its prognostic and therapeutic values in this deadly disease. Overall, 175 cases of lung adenocarcinoma sample were included in this study. Histological subtyping of them was diagnosed according to standards of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society in 2011. Protein expression of SLC34A2 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase in these samples was determined by immunohistochemistry. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were examined using amplification refractory mutation system. Statistical analysis was performed using software of Pearson's correlation coefficient. High expression of SLC34A2 was identified in about 2/3 patients and correlated with significantly better patient's overall survival. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were detected in about 53% of patients with no statistically significant difference to patient's overall survival. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement was found in 8 out of 175 patients, harboring this abnormality leads to shorter overall survival. No correlation has been found between SLC34A2 expression and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma. High expression of SLC34A2 is present in about 3/4 lung adenocarcinoma samples and predicts better outcome. Since it is a membrane protein, antibody-based drugs targeting this marker might bring new resolution to this deadly disease.\n28720066\t19\t26\tSLC34A2\tGene\t10568\n28720066\t63\t82\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28720066\t83\t91\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28720066\t110\t117\tSLC34A2\tGene\t10568\n28720066\t130\t136\ttumors\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n28720066\t202\t228\tnon-small cell lung cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D002289\n28720066\t277\t296\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28720066\t316\t323\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28720066\t437\t456\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28720066\t611\t622\tLung Cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D008175\n28720066\t709\t716\tSLC34A2\tGene\t10568\n28720066\t732\t740\tlymphoma\tDisease\tMESH:D008223\n28720066\t805\t837\tEpidermal growth factor receptor\tGene\t1956\n28720066\t1017\t1024\tSLC34A2\tGene\t10568\n28720066\t1053\t1061\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28720066\t1103\t1110\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28720066\t1131\t1163\tEpidermal growth factor receptor\tGene\t1956\n28720066\t1204\t1212\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28720066\t1261\t1268\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28720066\t1289\t1308\tAnaplastic lymphoma\tDisease\tMESH:D017728\n28720066\t1356\t1364\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28720066\t1466\t1473\tSLC34A2\tGene\t10568\n28720066\t1489\t1521\tepidermal growth factor receptor\tGene\t1956\n28720066\t1545\t1553\tlymphoma\tDisease\tMESH:D008223\n28720066\t1579\t1598\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n28720066\t1619\t1626\tSLC34A2\tGene\t10568\n28720066\t1651\t1670\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n\n"b'28834269|t|Prognostic significance of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification of stage I lung adenocarcinoma: A retrospective study based on analysis of 110 Chinese patients.\n28834269|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between predominant subtype, classification, and prognosis in Chinese stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (IASLC/ATS/ERS) International Multidisciplinary Lung Adenocarcinoma Classification. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2010, 110 patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma underwent surgery at Xuanwu Hospital. Two pathologists independently reclassified all resected specimens according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There were no cases of adenocarcinoma in situ, and three cases of minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. There were 107 cases of invasive adenocarcinoma: 12 lepidic, 32 acinar, 30 papillary, 18 micropapillary, and 15 solid predominant subtypes. Patients with micropapillary and solid predominant tumors had significantly poorer disease-free survival compared to those with other subtypes of predominant tumors (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.021). Multivariate analysis revealed that the new classification (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.003) and T stage (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.034) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival, respectively.

Recently, microRNAs are found to have potential as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer. As evidence suggests microRNA dysregulations are implicated in many cancer malignancies, it is important to consider the changes in miRNA-target associations among different lung cancer biological states. We proposed a novel clustering strategy to identify groups of miRNAs with similar dysregulated targets. Then, we incorporated the learned clusters of miRNA as prior knowledge to a Sparse Group Lasso classifier to improve classification results, thereby leading to more relevant selection of microRNA biomarkers. We apply the method to the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma dataset. In cross-validation tests, the AUC rate for each stages is 1.0, 0.71, 0.68, 0.64, and 0.90 for normal, Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV, respectively. Among the candidate miRNAs selected in the model, 87% are reported to be related to Lung Adenocarcinoma. Further result demonstrates that clustering miRNAs by considering the dysregulation between miRNAs and mRNA targets leads to biomarkers with higher precision and recall rate to known lung adenocarcinoma miRNAs.\n29060458\t56\t75\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n29060458\t160\t166\tdeaths\tDisease\tMESH:D003643\n29060458\t178\t189\tlung cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D008175\n29060458\t266\t285\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n29060458\t388\t399\tlung cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D008175\n29060458\t469\t488\tcancer malignancies\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n29060458\t575\t586\tlung cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D008175\n29060458\t955\t969\tAdenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D000230\n29060458\t1224\t1243\tLung Adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n29060458\t1428\t1454\tlung adenocarcinoma miRNAs\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n\n'b'29261648|t|Regulation of the cohesin-loading factor NIPBL: Role of the lncRNA NIPBL-AS1 and identification of a distal enhancer element.\n29261648|a|Cohesin is crucial for genome stability, cell division, transcription and chromatin organization. Its functions critically depend on NIPBL, the cohesin-loader protein that is found to be mutated in >60% of the cases of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). Other mutations are described in the cohesin subunits SMC1A, RAD21, SMC3 and the HDAC8 protein. In 25-30% of CdLS cases no mutation in the known CdLS genes is detected. Until now, functional elements in the noncoding genome were not characterized in the molecular etiology of CdLS and therefore are excluded from mutation screening, although the impact of such mutations has now been recognized for a wide range of diseases. We have identified different elements of the noncoding genome involved in regulation of the NIPBL gene. NIPBL-AS1 is a long non-coding RNA transcribed upstream and antisense to NIPBL. By knockdown and transcription blocking experiments, we could show that not the NIPBL-AS1 gene product, but its actual transcription is important to regulate NIPBL expression levels. This reveals a possibility to boost the transcriptional activity of the NIPBL gene by interfering with the NIPBL-AS1 lncRNA. Further, we have identified a novel distal enhancer regulating both NIPBL and NIPBL-AS1. Deletion of the enhancer using CRISPR genome editing in HEK293T cells reduces expression of NIPBL, NIPBL-AS1 as well as genes found to be dysregulated in CdLS.\n29261648\t41\t46\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t67\t76\tNIPBL-AS1\tGene\t646719\n29261648\t259\t264\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t345\t371\tCornelia de Lange syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29261648\t373\t377\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29261648\t434\t439\tSMC1A\tGene\t8243\n29261648\t441\t446\tRAD21\tGene\t5885\n29261648\t448\t452\tSMC3\tGene\t9126\n29261648\t461\t466\tHDAC8\tGene\t55869\n29261648\t489\t493\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29261648\t525\t529\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29261648\t656\t660\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29261648\t897\t902\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t909\t918\tNIPBL-AS1\tGene\t646719\n29261648\t982\t987\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t1069\t1078\tNIPBL-AS1\tGene\t646719\n29261648\t1147\t1152\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t1244\t1249\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t1279\t1288\tNIPBL-AS1\tGene\t646719\n29261648\t1365\t1370\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t1375\t1384\tNIPBL-AS1\tGene\t646719\n29261648\t1442\t1449\tHEK293T\tCellLine\tCVCL:0063\n29261648\t1478\t1483\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29261648\t1485\t1494\tNIPBL-AS1\tGene\t646719\n29261648\t1540\t1544\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n\n'b'29271604|t|The novel RAF1 mutation p.(Gly361Ala) located outside the kinase domain of the CR3 region in two patients with Noonan syndrome, including one with a rare brain tumor.\n29271604|a|Noonan syndrome is characterized by typical craniofacial dysmorphism, postnatal growth retardation, congenital heart defect, and learning difficulties and belongs to the RASopathies, a group of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by germline mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Mutations in the RAF1 gene are associated with Noonan syndrome, with a high prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). RAF1 mutations cluster in exons encoding the conserved region 2 (CR2), the kinase activation segment of the CR3 domain, and the C-terminus. We present two boys with Noonan syndrome and the identical de novo RAF1 missense variant c.1082G>C/p.(Gly361Ala) affecting the CR3, but located outside the kinase activation segment. The p.(Gly361Ala) mutation has been identified as a RAF1 allele conferring resistance to RAF inhibitors. This amino acid change favors a RAF1 conformation that allows for enhanced RAF dimerization and increased intrinsic kinase activity. Both patients with Noonan syndrome showed typical craniofacial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, and short stature. One individual developed HCM and was diagnosed with a disseminated oligodendroglial-like leptomeningeal tumor (DOLT) of childhood at the age of 9 years. While there is a well-established association of NS with malignant tumors, especially childhood hemato-oncological diseases, brain tumors have rarely been reported in Noonan syndrome. Our data demonstrate that mutation scanning of the entire coding region of genes associated with Noonan syndrome is mandatory not to miss rare variants located outside the known mutational hotspots.\n29271604\t10\t14\tRAF1\tGene\t5894\n29271604\t79\t82\tCR3\tGene\t6998\n29271604\t97\t105\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n29271604\t111\t126\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n29271604\t154\t165\tbrain tumor\tDisease\tMESH:D001932\n29271604\t167\t182\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n29271604\t211\t235\tcraniofacial dysmorphism\tDisease\tMESH:D019465\n29271604\t237\t265\tpostnatal growth retardation\tDisease\tMESH:D006130\n29271604\t267\t290\tcongenital heart defect\tDisease\tMESH:D006330\n29271604\t296\t317\tlearning difficulties\tDisease\tMESH:C567453\n29271604\t337\t348\tRASopathies\tDisease\t\n29271604\t361\t389\tneurodevelopmental disorders\tDisease\tMESH:D002658\n29271604\t490\t494\tRAF1\tGene\t5894\n29271604\t520\t535\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n29271604\t563\t590\thypertrophic cardiomyopathy\tDisease\tMESH:D002312\n29271604\t592\t595\tHCM\tDisease\tMESH:D002312\n29271604\t598\t602\tRAF1\tGene\t5894\n29271604\t706\t709\tCR3\tGene\t6998\n29271604\t753\t757\tboys\tSpecies\t9606\n29271604\t763\t778\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n29271604\t805\t809\tRAF1\tGene\t5894\n29271604\t827\t836\tc.1082G>C\tDNAMutation\tc.1082G>C;RS#:397516813(Expired)\n29271604\t865\t868\tCR3\tGene\t6998\n29271604\t973\t977\tRAF1\tGene\t5894\n29271604\t1010\t1013\tRAF\tGene\t22882\n29271604\t1058\t1062\tRAF1\tGene\t5894\n29271604\t1101\t1104\tRAF\tGene\t22882\n29271604\t1164\t1172\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n29271604\t1178\t1193\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n29271604\t1209\t1233\tcraniofacial dysmorphism\tDisease\tMESH:D019465\n29271604\t1235\t1247\tmacrocephaly\tDisease\tMESH:D058627\n29271604\t1253\t1266\tshort stature\tDisease\tMESH:D006130\n29271604\t1293\t1296\tHCM\tDisease\tMESH:D002312\n29271604\t1335\t1377\toligodendroglial-like leptomeningeal tumor\tDisease\tMESH:D008577\n29271604\t1478\t1494\tmalignant tumors\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n29271604\t1517\t1544\themato-oncological diseases\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n29271604\t1546\t1558\tbrain tumors\tDisease\tMESH:D001932\n29271604\t1588\t1603\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n29271604\t1702\t1717\tNoonan syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D009634\n\n'b'29279609|t|Molecular characterization of HDAC8 deletions in individuals with atypical Cornelia de Lange syndrome.\n29279609|a|Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome for which mutations in five causative genes that encode (SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21) or regulate (NIPBL, HDAC8) the cohesin complex, account for ~70% of cases. Herein we report on four female Subjects who were found to carry novel intragenic deletions in HDAC8. In one case, the deletion was found in mosaic state and it was determined to be present in ~38% of blood lymphocytes and in nearly all cells of a buccal sample. All deletions, for which parental blood samples were available, were shown to have arisen de novo. X-chromosome inactivation studies demonstrated marked skewing, suggesting strong selection against the mutated HDAC8 allele. Based on an investigation of the deletion breakpoints, we hypothesize that microhomology-mediated replicative mechanisms may be implicated in the formation of some of these rearrangements. This study broadens the mutational spectrum of HDAC8, provides the first description of a causative HDAC8 somatic mutation and increases the knowledge on possible mutational mechanisms underlying copy number variations in HDAC8.

NIPBL, a cohesin regulatory protein, has been identified as a critical protein responsible for the orchestration of transcriptomic regulatory networks necessary for embryonic development. Mutations in NIPBL are responsible for the majority of cases of CdLS. Through RNA-sequencing of human induced pluripotent stem cells and in vitro-derived cardiomyocytes, we identified hundreds of mRNAs, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs with altered expression in NIPBL+/- patient-derived cells. We demonstrate that NIPBL haploinsufficiency leads to upregulation of gene sets identified in functions related to nucleosome, chromatin assembly, RNA modification and downregulation of Wnt signaling, cholesterol biosynthesis and vesicular transport in iPSC and cardiomyocytes. Mutations in NIPBL result in the dysregulation of many genes responsible for normal heart development likely resulting in the variety of structural cardiac defects observed in the CdLS population.\n29348408\t0\t5\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29348408\t9\t27\thaploinsufficiency\tDisease\tMESH:D058495\n29348408\t120\t146\tCornelia de Lange syndrome\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29348408\t148\t152\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29348408\t159\t175\tcomplex disorder\tDisease\tMESH:C537708\n29348408\t205\t226\tdevelopmental defects\tDisease\tMESH:D009436\n29348408\t318\t353\tNIPBL, a cohesin regulatory protein\tGene\t25836\n29348408\t519\t524\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29348408\t570\t574\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n29348408\t602\t607\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n29348408\t769\t774\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29348408\t778\t785\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n29348408\t821\t826\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29348408\t827\t845\thaploinsufficiency\tDisease\tMESH:D058495\n29348408\t1002\t1013\tcholesterol\tChemical\tMESH:D002784\n29348408\t1092\t1097\tNIPBL\tGene\t25836\n29348408\t1227\t1242\tcardiac defects\tDisease\tMESH:D006331\n29348408\t1259\t1263\tCdLS\tDisease\tMESH:D003635\n\n'b'29379197|t|BRD4 interacts with NIPBL and BRD4 is mutated in a Cornelia de Lange-like syndrome.\n29379197|a|We found that the clinical phenotype associated with BRD4 haploinsufficiency overlapped with that of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), which is most often caused by mutation of NIPBL.

We also found that antioxidant treatment partially rescued the phenotype of a zebrafish model of CdLS.

Biomarkers predicting survival of patients with lung cancer have a profound effect on patient prognosis and treatment. However, predictive biomarkers for survival and their relevance for lung cancer are not been well known yet. The objective of this study was to perform machine learning with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to find survival-specific gene mutations that could be used as survival-predicting biomarkers. To identify survival-specific mutations according to various clinical factors, four feature selection methods (information gain, chi-squared test, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and correlation) were used. Extracted survival-specific mutations of LUAD were applied individually or as a group for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Mutations in MMRN2 and GMPPA were significantly associated with patient mortality while those in ZNF560 and SETX were associated with patient survival. Mutations in DNAJC2 and MMRN2 showed significant negative association with overall survival while mutations in ZNF560 showed significant positive association with overall survival. Mutations in MMRN2 showed significant negative association with disease-free survival while mutations in DRD3 and ZNF560 showed positive associated with disease-free survival. Mutations in DRD3, SETX, and ZNF560 showed significant positive association with survival in patients with LUAD while the opposite was true for mutations in DNAJC2, GMPPA, and MMRN2. These gene mutations were also found in other cohorts of LUAD, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. In LUAD of Pan-Lung Cancer cohort, mutations in GMPPA, DNAJC2, and MMRN2 showed significant negative associations with survival of patients while mutations in DRD3 and SETX showed significant positive association with survival. In this study, machine learning was conducted to obtain information necessary to discover specific gene mutations associated with the survival of patients with LUAD. Mutations in the above six genes could predict survival rate and disease-free survival rate in patients with LUAD. Thus, they are important biomarker candidates for prognosis.\n30419062\t86\t105\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t112\t118\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30419062\t145\t151\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30419062\t211\t217\tcancer\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n30419062\t218\t226\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t262\t270\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t276\t287\tlung cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D008175\n30419062\t314\t321\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t415\t426\tlung cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D008175\n30419062\t558\t566\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t572\t591\tlung adenocarcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t593\t597\tLUAD\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t948\t952\tLUAD\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t1042\t1047\tMMRN2\tGene\t79812\n30419062\t1052\t1057\tGMPPA\tGene\t29926\n30419062\t1093\t1100\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t1126\t1132\tZNF560\tGene\t147741\n30419062\t1137\t1141\tSETX\tGene\t23064\n30419062\t1163\t1170\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t1194\t1200\tDNAJC2\tGene\t27000\n30419062\t1205\t1210\tMMRN2\tGene\t79812\n30419062\t1292\t1298\tZNF560\tGene\t147741\n30419062\t1375\t1380\tMMRN2\tGene\t79812\n30419062\t1467\t1471\tDRD3\tGene\t1814\n30419062\t1476\t1482\tZNF560\tGene\t147741\n30419062\t1551\t1555\tDRD3\tGene\t1814\n30419062\t1557\t1561\tSETX\tGene\t23064\n30419062\t1567\t1573\tZNF560\tGene\t147741\n30419062\t1631\t1639\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t1645\t1649\tLUAD\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t1695\t1701\tDNAJC2\tGene\t27000\n30419062\t1703\t1708\tGMPPA\tGene\t29926\n30419062\t1714\t1719\tMMRN2\tGene\t79812\n30419062\t1778\t1782\tLUAD\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t1784\t1812\tlung squamous cell carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D002294\n30419062\t1818\t1840\tsmall cell lung cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D055752\n30419062\t1845\t1849\tLUAD\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t1890\t1895\tGMPPA\tGene\t29926\n30419062\t1897\t1903\tDNAJC2\tGene\t27000\n30419062\t1909\t1914\tMMRN2\tGene\t79812\n30419062\t1973\t1981\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t2001\t2005\tDRD3\tGene\t1814\n30419062\t2010\t2014\tSETX\tGene\t23064\n30419062\t2216\t2224\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t2230\t2234\tLUAD\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n30419062\t2331\t2339\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n30419062\t2345\t2349\tLUAD\tDisease\tMESH:C538231\n\n'
