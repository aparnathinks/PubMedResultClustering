Primary cilium dysfunction underlies the pathogenesis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a genetic disorder whose symptoms include obesity, retinal degeneration, and nephropathy. However, despite the identification of 12 BBS genes, the molecular basis of BBS remains elusive. Here we identify a complex composed of seven highly conserved BBS proteins. This complex, the BBSome, localizes to nonmembranous centriolar satellites in the cytoplasm but also to the membrane of the cilium. Interestingly, the BBSome is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Strikingly, Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Conversely, preventing Rab8(GTP) production blocks ciliation in cells and yields characteristic BBS phenotypes in zebrafish. Our data reveal that BBS may be caused by defects in vesicular transport to the cilium.", "sourceid": "17574030", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D020788", "span": {"begin": 160, "end": 181}}, {"obj": "Disease:D049932", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 186}}, {"obj": "Disease:D030342", "span": {"begin": 191, "end": 207}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009765", "span": {"begin": 231, "end": 238}}, {"obj": "Disease:D012162", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 260}}, {"obj": "Disease:D007674", "span": {"begin": 266, "end": 277}}, {"obj": "Chemical:C092236", "span": {"begin": 1135, "end": 1141}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D006160", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 961}}, {"obj": "Chemical:C092236", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 881}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D006160", "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 854}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D006160", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 757}}, {"obj": "Chemical:C092236", "span": {"begin": 576, "end": 582}}, {"obj": "Gene:571897", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 62}}, {"obj": "Gene:571897", "span": {"begin": 745, "end": 749}}, {"obj": "Gene:571897", "span": {"begin": 846, "end": 850}}, {"obj": "Gene:571897", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 957}}, {"obj": "Species:7955", "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1053}}]}, "26586152": {"sourcedb": "PubMed", "text": "Value of MRI olfactory bulb evaluation in the assessment of olfactory dysfunction in Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in at least seven loci (BBS1-7), five of which are cloned (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS6, and BBS7). Genetic and mutational analyses have indicated that, in some families, a combination of three mutant alleles at two loci (triallelic inheritance) is necessary for pathogenesis. To date, four of the five known BBS loci have been implicated in this mode of oligogenic disease transmission. We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum, distribution, and involvement in non-Mendelian trait transmission of mutant alleles in BBS1, the most common BBS locus. Analyses of 259 independent families segregating a BBS phenotype indicate that BBS1 participates in complex inheritance and that, in different families, mutations in BBS1 can interact genetically with mutations at each of the other known BBS genes, as well as at unknown loci, to cause the phenotype. Consistent with this model, we identified homozygous M390R alleles, the most frequent BBS1 mutation, in asymptomatic individuals in two families. Moreover, our statistical analyses indicate that the prevalence of the M390R allele in the general population is consistent with an oligogenic rather than a recessive model of disease transmission. The distribution of BBS oligogenic alleles also indicates that all BBS loci might interact genetically with each other, but some genes, especially BBS2 and BBS6, are more likely to participate in triallelic inheritance, suggesting a variable ability of the BBS proteins to interact genetically with each other.", "sourceid": "12677556", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D020788", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 141}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009358", "span": {"begin": 174, "end": 196}}, {"obj": "Disease:D020788", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 118}}, {"obj": "Disease:D049932", "span": {"begin": 823, "end": 826}}, {"obj": "Disease:D049932", "span": {"begin": 1484, "end": 1487}}, {"obj": "Gene:582", "span": {"begin": 23, "end": 27}}, {"obj": "Gene:54585;582;583;84100;585;129880;8195;55212", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 247}}, {"obj": "Gene:582", "span": {"begin": 276, "end": 280}}, {"obj": "Gene:583", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 286}}, {"obj": "Gene:585", "span": {"begin": 288, "end": 292}}, {"obj": "Gene:8195", "span": {"begin": 294, "end": 298}}, {"obj": "Gene:55212", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 308}}, {"obj": "Gene:582", "span": {"begin": 739, "end": 743}}, {"obj": "Gene:582", "span": {"begin": 851, "end": 855}}, {"obj": "Gene:582", "span": {"begin": 938, "end": 942}}, {"obj": "Gene:582", "span": {"begin": 1159, "end": 1163}}, {"obj": "Gene:583", "span": {"begin": 1564, "end": 1568}}, {"obj": "Gene:8195", "span": {"begin": 1573, "end": 1577}}, {"obj": "Mutation:p|SUB|M|390|R;RS#:113624356", "span": {"begin": 1126, "end": 1131}}, {"obj": "Mutation:p|SUB|M|390|R;RS#:113624356", "span": {"begin": 1290, "end": 1295}}]}, "25080519": {"sourcedb": "PubMed", "text": "Observational study of spinal muscular atrophy type I and implications for clinical trials.

Intervention was determined by published standard of care guidelines. Palliative care options were offered. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 54 eligible subjects with SMA-I (63%) enrolled and 50% of these completed at least 12 months of follow-up. The median age at reaching the combined endpoint of death or requiring at least 16 hours/day of ventilation support was 13.5 months (interquartile range 8.1-22.0 months). Requirement for nutritional support preceded that for ventilation support. The distribution of age at reaching the combined endpoint was similar for subjects with SMA-I who had symptom onset before 3 months and after 3 months of age (p=0.58). Having 2 SMN2 copies was associated with greater morbidity and mortality than having 3 copies. Baseline electrophysiologic measures indicated substantial motor neuron loss. By comparison, subjects with SMA-II who lost sitting ability (n=10) had higher motor function, motor unit number estimate and compound motor action potential, longer survival, and later age when feeding or ventilation support was required.

To test the hypothesis that accelerated Na(+) transport alone can produce cystic fibrosis-like lung disease, we generated mice with airway-specific overexpression of epithelial Na(+) channels (ENaC).

Interestingly, water loading (WL) did not result in a significant reduction of Uosm, indicating combined concentrating and diluting defects. dDAVP infusion induced a significant increase of plasma Factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor levels, supporting normal function of the type 2 vasopressin receptor at least in endothelial cells.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Almost 15 years have now passed since bacterial community profiling techniques were first used to analyse respiratory samples from people with cystic fibrosis. Since then, many different analytical approaches have been used to try to better understand the contribution of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiota to disease, with varying degrees of success. We examine the extent to which cystic fibrosis respiratory microbiome research has been successful in informing clinical decision-making, and highlight areas that we believe have the potential to yield important insight. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome can be broadly divided into efforts to better characterize microbiota composition, particularly relative to key clinical events, and attempts to understand the cystic fibrosis lung microbiology as an interactive microbial system. The latter, in particular, has led to the development of a number of models in which microbiome-mediated processes precipitate clinical events. SUMMARY: Growing technological sophistication is enabling increasingly detailed microbiological data to be generated from cystic fibrosis respiratory samples. However, translating these data into clinically useful measures that accurately predict outcomes and guide treatments remains a formidable challenge. The development of systems biology approaches that enable the integration of complex microbiome and host-derived data provide an exciting opportunity to address this goal.", "sourceid": "28786882", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D003550", "span": {"begin": 12, "end": 27}}, {"obj": "Disease:D003550", "span": {"begin": 253, "end": 268}}, {"obj": "Disease:D005355", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 406}}, {"obj": "Disease:D003550", "span": {"begin": 494, "end": 509}}, {"obj": "Disease:D005355", "span": {"begin": 724, "end": 755}}, {"obj": "Disease:D005355", "span": {"begin": 916, "end": 936}}, {"obj": "Disease:D003550", "span": {"begin": 1252, "end": 1267}}, {"obj": "Species:2", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 157}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 247}}]}, "24715477": {"sourcedb": "PubMed", "text": "The high frequency of genetic diseases in hypotonic infants referred by neuropediatrics.

In this study, we evaluated the anticancer properties of cardiac glycoside Digitoxin (Dtx) and its synthetic analog MonoD on breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer) and MDA-MB-468 (triple-negative breast cancer). Both cardiac glycosides, at concentrations within the therapeutic range, increased the fraction of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, decreased viability, and inhibited the migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Both cardiac glycosides increased production of superoxide and induced apoptosis in both cell types. Reduced protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B and IkappaB kinase-beta were found in cardiac glycoside-treated cells, indicating that the cellular effects of these compounds are mediated via nuclear factor kappa B pathway. This study demonstrates the cytotoxic potential of digitoxin, and more importantly its synthetic analog MonoD, in the treatment of triple-positive breast cancer and more importantly the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer.

This study was retrospectively performed on 101 patients with stage II and III invasive breast cancer who received 6-8 cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Out of the total, 23 were in the triple negative breast cancer subgroup. Nuclear Ki-67 expression in both the large cohort group (n=101) and triple negative breast cancer subgroup (n=23) and its relation to the pathological response were evaluated. The purpose of the study was to identify the predictive value of nuclear protein Ki-67 expression among patients with invasive breast cancers, involving the triple negative breast cancer subgroup, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in correlation to the rate of pathological complete response. The proliferation marker Ki-67 expression was highest in the triple negative breast cancer subgroup. No appreciable difference in the rate of Ki-67 expression in triple negative breast cancer subgroup using either a cutoff of 14% or 35%. Triple negative breast cancer subgroup showed lower rates of pathological complete response.

Primary cilia are cellular appendages important for signal transduction and sensing the environment. Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins form a complex that is important for several cytoskeleton-related processes such as ciliogenesis, cell migration and division. However, the mechanisms by which BBS proteins may regulate the cytoskeleton remain unclear. We discovered that Bbs4- and Bbs6-deficient renal medullary cells display a characteristic behaviour comprising poor migration, adhesion and division with an inability to form lamellipodial and filopodial extensions. Moreover, fewer mutant cells were ciliated [48%    6 for wild-type (WT) cells versus 23%    7 for Bbs4 null cells; P < 0.0001] and their cilia were shorter (2.55  m    0.41 for WT cells versus 2.16  m    0.23 for Bbs4 null cells; P < 0.0001). While the microtubular cytoskeleton and cortical actin were intact, actin stress fibre formation was severely disrupted, forming abnormal apical stress fibre aggregates. Furthermore, we observed over-abundant focal adhesions (FAs) in Bbs4-, Bbs6- and Bbs8-deficient cells. In view of these findings and the role of RhoA in regulation of actin filament polymerization, we showed that RhoA-GTP levels were highly upregulated in the absence of Bbs proteins. Upon treatment of Bbs4-deficient cells with chemical inhibitors of RhoA, we were able to restore the cilia length and number as well as the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton.

Within a decade of the early descriptions, the autosomal recessive nature of this genetic disease had been clarified, and its clinical features had been expanded. Secondary nutritional deficiencies complicated the underlying condition: the first clear description of CF as \"a new disease\", which included a speculation about its genetic basis (because there were 2 pairs of sibs in the case series) was published as Vitamin A deficiency in children [2]. The diagnosis was most often made at autopsy. When it was suspected in life, the diagnostic tests used included duodenal intubation to obtain fluid which would show impaired tryptic digestion of the coating of X-Ray film in CF children, and measurement of vitamin A in the blood. Some nutritional improvement could be expected with simple, rather inefficient pancreatic enzyme preparations, but it was not until mid-century that antibiotics began to treat pulmonary infections effectively.

Cystic fibrosis is a common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder, with highest prevalence in Europe, North America, and Australia. The disease is caused by mutation of a gene that encodes a chloride-conducting transmembrane channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which regulates anion transport and mucociliary clearance in the airways. Functional failure of CFTR results in mucus retention and chronic infection and subsequently in local airway inflammation that is harmful to the lungs. CFTR dysfunction mainly affects epithelial cells, although there is evidence of a role in immune cells. Cystic fibrosis affects several body systems, and morbidity and mortality is mostly caused by bronchiectasis, small airways obstruction, and progressive respiratory impairment. Important comorbidities caused by epithelial cell dysfunction occur in the pancreas (malabsorption), liver (biliary cirrhosis), sweat glands (heat shock), and vas deferens (infertility). The development and delivery of drugs that improve the clearance of mucus from the lungs and treat the consequent infection, in combination with correction of pancreatic insufficiency and undernutrition by multidisciplinary teams, have resulted in remarkable improvements in quality of life and clinical outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis, with median life expectancy now older than 40 years. Innovative and transformational therapies that target the basic defect in cystic fibrosis have recently been developed and are effective in improving lung function and reducing pulmonary exacerbations.

DEPDC1 over-expression facilitated cell proliferation and tumor growth through increasing the expression of FOXM1 in TNBC cells. Conversely, knockdown of DEPDC1 had the opposite effects. Moreover, miR-26b, acting as a tumor suppressor in TNBC, directly repressed the expression of DEPDC1 and mitigated its promotive effects on cell growth and colony formation. These results indicate that DEPDC1, negatively regulated by miR-26b, promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth via up-regulating FOXM1 expression, implying an important underlying mechanism of regulating the progression of TNBC.", "sourceid": "30419349", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 152}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 158}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 121}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 295, "end": 300}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 372, "end": 376}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 407, "end": 420}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 575}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 643, "end": 647}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 759}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 813, "end": 817}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 914, "end": 919}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 934, "end": 938}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 1158, "end": 1163}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1283, "end": 1287}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D011374", "span": {"begin": 206, "end": 218}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D004967", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 194}}, {"obj": "Gene:55635", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 6}}, {"obj": "Gene:407017", "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 39}}, {"obj": "Gene:2305", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 102}}, {"obj": "Gene:2064", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 246}}, {"obj": "Gene:55635", "span": {"begin": 601, "end": 607}}, {"obj": "Gene:55635", "span": {"begin": 696, "end": 702}}, {"obj": "Gene:2305", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 809}}, {"obj": "Gene:55635", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 856}}, {"obj": "Gene:407017", "span": {"begin": 893, "end": 900}}, {"obj": "Gene:55635", "span": {"begin": 977, "end": 983}}, {"obj": "Gene:55635", "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1091}}, {"obj": "Gene:407017", "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1124}}, {"obj": "Gene:2305", "span": {"begin": 1189, "end": 1194}}]}, "26141073": {"sourcedb": "PubMed", "text": "Gene therapy trial for cystic fibrosis shows modest benefits.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs composed of 18-25 nucleotides that can post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and have key regulatory roles in cancer, acting as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors. About 1000 genes in humans encode miRNAs, which account for approximately 3% of the human genome, and up to 30% of human protein coding genes may be regulated by miRNAs. The objective of this article is to evaluate the expression profile of four miRNAs previously implicated in triple negative breast cancer: miR-10b, miR-26a, miR-146a and miR-153, and to determine their possible interaction in triple negative and non triple negative breast cancer based on clinical outcome and the expression of BRCA1. 24 triple-negative and 13 non triple negative breast cancer cases, were studied by q-RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to determine the expression of the four studied miRNAs and the BRCA1 protein, respectively. We observed that the BRCA1 protein was absent in 62.5% of the triple negative cases. Besides, the miR-146a and miR-26a were over expressed in triple negative breast cancer. These two miRNAs, miR-10b and miR-153 were significantly associated to lymph node metastases occurrence in triple negative breast carcinoma. All the analyzed microRNAs were not associated with the expression of BRCA1 in our conditions. Our work provides evidence that miR-146a, miR-26a, miR-10b and miR-153 could be defined as biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer to predict lymph node metastases (LNM).", "sourceid": "28101798", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 294, "end": 300}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 331, "end": 336}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 644, "end": 657}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 786, "end": 799}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 901, "end": 914}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1222, "end": 1235}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009362", "span": {"begin": 1319, "end": 1329}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1344, "end": 1376}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1594, "end": 1607}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009362", "span": {"begin": 1630, "end": 1640}}, {"obj": "Gene:406903", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 7}}, {"obj": "Gene:407015", "span": {"begin": 9, "end": 16}}, {"obj": "Gene:406938", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 26}}, {"obj": "Gene:406903", "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 666}}, {"obj": "Gene:407015", "span": {"begin": 668, "end": 675}}, {"obj": "Gene:406938", "span": {"begin": 677, "end": 685}}, {"obj": "Gene:672", "span": {"begin": 848, "end": 853}}, {"obj": "Gene:672", "span": {"begin": 1035, "end": 1040}}, {"obj": "Gene:672", "span": {"begin": 1085, "end": 1090}}, {"obj": "Gene:406938", "span": {"begin": 1162, "end": 1170}}, {"obj": "Gene:407015", "span": {"begin": 1175, "end": 1182}}, {"obj": "Gene:406903", "span": {"begin": 1255, "end": 1262}}, {"obj": "Gene:672", "span": {"begin": 1448, "end": 1453}}, {"obj": "Gene:406938", "span": {"begin": 1505, "end": 1513}}, {"obj": "Gene:407015", "span": {"begin": 1515, "end": 1522}}, {"obj": "Gene:406903", "span": {"begin": 1524, "end": 1531}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 376}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 434, "end": 439}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 465, "end": 470}}]}, "28449677": {"sourcedb": "PubMed", "text": "Cystic fibrosis: current therapeutic targets and future approaches. OBJECTIVES: Study of currently approved drugs and exploration of future clinical development pipeline therapeutics for cystic fibrosis, and possible limitations in their use. METHODS: Extensive literature search using individual and a combination of key words related to cystic fibrosis therapeutics. KEY FINDINGS: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in CFTR gene leading to abnormality of chloride channels in mucus and sweat producing cells. Respiratory system and GIT are primarily involved but eventually multiple organs are affected leading to life threatening complications. Management requires drug therapy, extensive physiotherapy and nutritional support. Previously, the focus was on symptomatic improvement and complication prevention but recently the protein rectifiers are being studied which are claimed to correct underlying structural and functional abnormalities. Some improvement is observed by the corrector drugs. Other promising approaches are gene therapy, targeting of cellular interactomes, and newer drugs for symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment has a long way to go as most of the existing therapeutics is for older children.

Recently, the genetic heterogeneity in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), proposed in 1979 by Sillence et al., has been confirmed with molecular genetic studies. At present, 17 genetic causes of OI and closely related disorders have been identified and it is expected that more will follow. Unlike most reviews that have been published in the last decade on the genetic causes and biochemical processes leading to OI, this review focuses on the clinical classification of OI and elaborates on the newly proposed OI classification from 2010, which returned to a descriptive and numerical grouping of five OI syndromic groups. The new OI nomenclature and the pre-and postnatal severity assessment introduced in this review, emphasize the importance of phenotyping in order to diagnose, classify, and assess severity of OI. This will provide patients and their families with insight into the probable course of the disorder and it will allow physicians to evaluate the effect of therapy. A careful clinical description in combination with knowledge of the specific molecular genetic cause is the starting point for development and assessment of therapy in patients with heritable disorders including OI.    2014 The Authors.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant type of breast cancer with ample vascularisation and high vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. The sex steroid hormone oestrogen is involved in several cellular activities associated with TNBC regulation. However, the role of oestrogen in VEGF expression and angiogenesis in TNBC remains unclear. In this study, we found that treatment with 17b-oestradiol (E2) inhibited VEGF mRNA and protein expression in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-436. To further elaborate on the phenomenon of E2-regulated angiogenesis, we showed that conditioned medium from the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468 treated with E2 inhibits the tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, the G-protein-coupled oestrogen receptor-1 (GPER-1)-specific agonist G-1 has a function similar to that of E2. While G-15, the selective antagonist of GPER-1, notably reversed the inhibitory effects of E2 and G-1 on VEGF expression and tube formation, suggesting that GPER-1 is involved in the E2-induced angiogenesis suppression in TNBC cells. Moreover, E2 inhibited in vivo tumour growth and angiogenesis and reduced the expression levels of VEGF, NF-kB/p65, STAT3, and the endothelial marker CD34 in MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumours. Our findings provide important evidence that E2 can inhibit VEGF expression and angiogenesis in TNBC by activating GPER-1, offering additional insight into tumour angiogenesis and targets for drug intervention in TNBC.", "sourceid": "30405852", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 136}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 138, "end": 142}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 174, "end": 187}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 71, "end": 84}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 371, "end": 375}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 462}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 598}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 749, "end": 753}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1226, "end": 1230}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 1269, "end": 1275}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 1417, "end": 1424}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1522, "end": 1526}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 1582, "end": 1588}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1639, "end": 1643}}, {"obj": "Chemical:CHEBI:50114", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 924}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D004958", "span": {"begin": 788, "end": 790}}, {"obj": "Chemical:", "span": {"begin": 524, "end": 538}}, {"obj": "Chemical:CHEBI:50114", "span": {"begin": 409, "end": 418}}, {"obj": "Chemical:CHEBI:50114", "span": {"begin": 302, "end": 311}}, {"obj": "Chemical:D013256", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 293}}, {"obj": "Chemical:CHEBI:50114", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 9}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 19, "end": 23}}, {"obj": "Gene:2852", "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 105}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 224, "end": 258}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 264}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 426}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 554, "end": 558}}, {"obj": "Gene:2852", "span": {"begin": 897, "end": 935}}, {"obj": "Gene:2852", "span": {"begin": 937, "end": 943}}, {"obj": "Gene:2852", "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1050}}, {"obj": "Gene:106478911;5544", "span": {"begin": 1095, "end": 1105}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 1109, "end": 1113}}, {"obj": "Gene:2852", "span": {"begin": 1161, "end": 1167}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 1337, "end": 1341}}, {"obj": "Gene:7422", "span": {"begin": 1486, "end": 1490}}, {"obj": "Gene:2852", "span": {"begin": 1541, "end": 1547}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 830, "end": 835}}]}, "23849732": {"sourcedb": "PubMed", "text": "The association between glomus tumors and neurofibromatosis.

METHODS: Using a pathology database, we established a study cohort consisting of all patients who had undergone excision of a glomus tumor of the hand between 1995 and 2010. We created a control cohort by randomly selecting 200 patients who had undergone excision of a ganglion cyst over the same period. We reviewed medical records for each cohort to identify patients with a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. We calculated the odds ratio was calculated and performed Fisher's exact test to determine the significance of the association. RESULTS: We identified 21 patients with glomus tumors of the hand. Six of these patients carried the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis (29%). In contrast, no patients in the control group carried the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. The odds ratio for a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis in association with a glomus tumor compared with controls was 168:1. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of a strong epidemiologic association between glomus tumors and neurofibromatosis.

UNASSIGNED: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) represents a rare ciliopathy recessive autosomal inherited. The main clinical features are retinal dystrophy, postaxial polydactyly, obesity, different degrees of cognitive deficit, renal impairment, hypogonadism and genital malformations. The genetic explanation consists in BBS genes mutations, which encode modified proteins, altering the function of the immotile cilia. As a multitude of BBS genes mutations were described, the phenotypic aspect of these disorders varies according to that. We present the case of a 22 years old female patient, known with BBS since the age of 11 and which was diagnosed and operated for bilateral ovarian dermoid cysts, at the age of 21. We did not find a similar case in literature, regarding the association between the two disorders. We consider that our case points towards the importance of periodic imagistic evaluations [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound] of these patients, not only clinical and biological.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, which causes death of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Genetic cause of SMA is the deletion or mutation of SMN1 gene, which encodes the SMN protein. Although SMA patients include SMN2 gene, a duplicate of SMN1 gene, predominant production of exon 7 skipped isoform from SMN2 pre-mRNA, fails to rescue SMA patients. Here we show that hnRNP M, a member of hnRNP protein family, when knocked down, promotes exon 7 skipping of both SMN2 and SMN1 pre-mRNA. By contrast, overexpression of hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion of both SMN2 and SMN1 pre-mRNA. Significantly, hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion in SMA patient cells. Thus, we conclude that hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion of both SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNA. We also demonstrate that hnRNP M contacts an enhancer on exon 7, which was previously shown to provide binding site for tra2b. We present evidence that hnRNP M and tra2b contact overlapped sequence on exon 7 but with slightly different RNA sequence requirements.

RECENT FINDINGS: Mutations in the two genes coding for collagen type I, COL1A1 and COL1A2, are the most common cause of osteogenesis imperfecta. In the past 10 years, defects in at least 17 other genes have been identified as responsible for osteogenesis imperfecta phenotypes, with either dominant or recessive transmission. Intravenous bisphosphonate infusions are the most widely used medical treatment. This has a marked effect on vertebra in growing children and can lead to vertebral reshaping after compression fractures. However, bisphosphonates are less effective for preventing long-bone fractures. At the moment, new therapies are under investigation. SUMMARY: Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta, more research is needed. Bisphosphonate treatment decreases long-bone fracture rates, but such fractures are still frequent.

Investigations using an array of sophisticated instruments at multiple scale levels have now determined many aspects of the effect of the disease on the material properties of bone tissue. The brittle nature of bone in osteogenesis imperfecta reflects both increased bone mineralisation density - the quantity of mineral in relation to the quantity of matrix within a specific bone volume - and altered matrix-matrix and matrix mineral interactions. Contributions to fracture resistance at multiple scale lengths are discussed, comparing normal and brittle bone. Integrating the available information provides both a better understanding of the effect of current approaches to treatment - largely improved architecture and possibly some macro-scale toughening - and indicates potential opportunities for alternative strategies that can influence fracture resistance at longer length scales.

Multi-modality cardiac imaging, especially recent echocardiographic techniques, evidenced diastolic and/or systolic ventricular dysfunction in cystic fibrosis leading to the concept of a cystic fibrosis-related cardiomyopathy. Hypoxemia and inflammation are among the most important factors for heart involvement in cystic fibrosis.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease consisting of several subtypes. Among these subtypes, triple negative breast cancer is particularly difficult to treat. This is due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms behind the disease, and consequently a lack of druggable targets. PAK4 plays critical roles in cell survival, proliferation, and morphology. PAK4 protein levels are high in breast cancer cells and breast tumors, and the gene is often amplified in basal like breast cancers, which are frequently triple negative. PAK4 is also overexpressed in other types of cancer, making it a promising drug target. However, its inhibition is complicated by the fact that PAK4 has both kinase-dependent and -independent functions. Here we investigate a new clinical compound KPT-9274, which has been shown to inhibit PAK4 and NAMPT. We find that KPT-9274 (and its analog, KPT-8752) can reduce the steady state level of PAK4 protein in triple negative breast cancer cells. These compounds also block the growth of the breast cancer cells in vitro, and stimulate apoptosis. Most importantly, oral administration of KPT-9274 reduces tumorigenesis in mouse models of human triple negative breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VI is an ultra-rare bone fragility disorder caused by recessive mutations in SERPINF1. Here, we describe long-term outcomes in OI type VI and compare the clinical phenotypes caused by different types of SERPINF1 mutations. METHODS: This study includes a retrospective chart review of 13 individuals with OI type VI. RESULTS: In the absence of therapy, lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (BMD) did not increase during childhood and longitudinal growth seemed to stall after the age of 6 to 8  years. The phenotype was similar between individuals with different types of SERPINF1 mutations. Intravenous bisphosphonate treatment was associated with an increase in lumbar spine areal BMD and some reshaping of compressed vertebral bodies. Patients who had started bisphosphonate treatment early (before the age of 6  years) were taller than patients who had received bisphosphonate treatment later during their growing years. Lower extremity fractures were frequent despite bisphosphonate treatment and scoliosis was present in all patients who had reached the final height. Most patients had restricted mobility. In four patients, intravenous bisphosphonate treatment was eventually substituted by subcutaneous injections of denosumab, without clear changes in the clinical picture.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous inherited human disorder displaying a pleotropic phenotype. Many of the symptoms characterized in the human disease have been reproduced in animal models carrying deletions or knock-in mutations of genes causal for the disorder. Thinning of the cerebral cortex, enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles, and structural changes in cilia are among the pathologies documented in these animal models. Ciliopathy is of particular interest in light of recent studies that have implicated primary neuronal cilia (PNC) in neuronal signal transduction. In the present investigation, we tested the hypothesis that areas of the brain responsible for learning and memory formation would differentially exhibit PNC abnormalities in animals carrying a deletion of the Bbs4 gene (Bbs4-/-). Immunohistochemical localization of adenylyl cyclase-III (ACIII), a marker restricted to PNC, revealed dramatic alterations in PNC morphology and a statistically significant reduction in number of immunopositive cilia in the hippocampus and amygdala of Bbs4-/- mice compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Western blot analysis confirmed the decrease of ACIII levels in the hippocampus and amygdala of Bbs4-/- mice, and electron microscopy demonstrated pathological alterations of PNC in the hippocampus and amygdala. Importantly, no neuronal loss was found within the subregions of amygdala and hippocampus sampled in Bbs4-/- mice and there were no statistically significant alterations of ACIII immunopositive cilia in other areas of the brain not known to contribute to the BBS phenotype. Considered with data documenting a role of cilia in signal transduction these findings support the conclusion that alterations in cilia structure or neurochemical phenotypes may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in the Bbs4-/- mouse mode.", "sourceid": "24695551", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D020788", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 115}}, {"obj": "Disease:D020788", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 120}}, {"obj": "Disease:D030342", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 177}}, {"obj": "Disease:D020788", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 80}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009410", "span": {"begin": 858, "end": 875}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009410", "span": {"begin": 1469, "end": 1482}}, {"obj": "Disease:D020788", "span": {"begin": 1712, "end": 1715}}, {"obj": "Disease:D003072", "span": {"begin": 1923, "end": 1941}}, {"obj": "Chemical:", "span": {"begin": 971, "end": 979}}, {"obj": "Gene:102774", "span": {"begin": 914, "end": 918}}, {"obj": "Gene:102774", "span": {"begin": 925, "end": 929}}, {"obj": "Gene:104111", "span": {"begin": 993, "end": 998}}, {"obj": "Gene:102774", "span": {"begin": 1188, "end": 1192}}, {"obj": "Gene:104111", "span": {"begin": 1289, "end": 1294}}, {"obj": "Gene:102774", "span": {"begin": 1337, "end": 1341}}, {"obj": "Gene:102774", "span": {"begin": 1554, "end": 1558}}, {"obj": "Gene:104111", "span": {"begin": 1626, "end": 1631}}, {"obj": "Gene:102774", "span": {"begin": 1958, "end": 1962}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 86}}, {"obj": "Species:9606", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 260}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 1196, "end": 1200}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 1345, "end": 1349}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 1562, "end": 1566}}, {"obj": "Species:10090", "span": {"begin": 1966, "end": 1971}}]}, "30419345": {"sourcedb": "PubMed", "text": "Immunological therapy: A novel thriving area for triple-negative breast cancer treatment.

These processes are orchestrated through the dynamic association of mRNAs with RNA binding proteins and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Accurate formation of RNPs in vivo is fundamentally important to cellular development and function, and its impairment often leads to human disease.

Androgen receptor (AR) inhibition has displayed efficacy against breast cancer preclinically and is currently being examined clinically in AR positive TNBC patients. Androgen deprivation has been shown to induce immunogenic modulation; the alteration of tumor cell phenotype resulting in increased sensitivity to immune-mediated killing. We evaluated the ability of AR inhibition to reduce the growth and improve the immune-mediated killing of breast cancer cells with differing expression of the estrogen receptor and AR. While AR expression was required for the growth inhibitory effects of enzalutamide on breast cancer cells, both enzalutamide and abiraterone improved the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to immune-mediated lysis independent of detectable AR expression. This increase in sensitivity was linked to an increase in cell surface tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor expression as well as a significant reduction in the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG).

Purpose: The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can mediate durable tumor regressions in patients with melanoma likely based on the recognition of immunogenic somatic mutations expressed by the cancer. There are limited data regarding the immunogenicity of mutations in breast cancer. We sought to identify immunogenic nonsynonymous mutations in a patient with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to identify and isolate mutation-reactive TILs for possible use in adoptive cell transfer.Experimental Design: A TNBC metastasis was resected for TIL generation and whole-exome sequencing. Tandem minigenes or long 25-mer peptides encoding selected mutations were electroporated or pulsed onto autologous antigen-presenting cells, and reactivity of TIL was screened by upregulation of CD137 and IFNy ELISPOT. The nature of the T-cell response against a unique nonsynonymous mutation was characterized.Results: We identified 72 nonsynonymous mutations from the tumor of a patient with TNBC. CD4+ and HLA-DRB1*1501-restricted TILs isolated from this tumor recognized a single mutation in RBPJ (recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region). Analysis of 16 metastatic sites revealed that the mutation was ubiquitously present in all samples.Conclusions: Breast cancers can express naturally processed and presented unique nonsynonymous mutations that are recognized by a patient's immune system. TILs recognizing these immunogenic mutations can be isolated from a patient's tumor, suggesting that adoptive cell transfer of mutation-reactive TILs could be a viable treatment option for patients with breast cancer.

Defects in proteins with very different functions, ranging from structural to enzymatic and from intracellular transport to chaperones, have been described in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. Knowledge of the specific molecular basis of each form of the disorder will advance clinical diagnosis and potentially stimulate targeted therapeutic approaches.

Sensitization to A. fumigatus is common in both atopic asthmatic and CF patients, yet only 1-2% of asthmatic and 7-9% of CF patients develop ABPA. ABPA is characterized by wheezing and pulmonary infiltrates which may lead to pulmonary fibrosis and/or bronchiectasis. The inflammatory response is characterized by Th2 responses to Aspergillus allergens, increased serum IgE and eosinophilia. A number of genetic risks have recently been identified in the development of ABPA. These include HLA-DR and HLA-DQ, IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4RA) polymorphisms, IL-10-1082GA promoter polymorphisms, surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2) polymorphisms, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) mutations. The studies indicate that ABPA patients are genetically at risk to develop skewed and heightened Th2 responses to A. fumigatus antigens. These genetic risk studies and their consequences of elevated biologic markers may aid in identifying asthmatic and CF patients who are at risk to the development of ABPA.

The more prevalent autosomal dominant forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are caused by primary defects in type I collagen, whereas autosomal recessive forms are caused by deficiency of proteins which interact with type I procollagen for post-translational modification and/or folding. Factors that contribute to the mechanism of dominant osteogenesis imperfecta include intracellular stress, disruption of interactions between collagen and noncollagenous proteins, compromised matrix structure, abnormal cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and tissue mineralization. Recessive osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by deficiency of any of the three components of the collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Absence of 3-hydroxylation is associated with increased modification of the collagen helix, consistent with delayed collagen folding. Other causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta include deficiency of the collagen chaperones FKBP10 or Serpin H1.

Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are an etiologically heterogeneous group of disorders of neurodegenerative origin, which result in degeneration of lower (LMNs) and/or upper motor neurons (UMNs). Neurodegenerative MNDs include pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which involves specific degeneration of UMNs, leading to progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. In contrast, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) involves the specific degeneration of LMNs, with symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset MND, is characterized by the degeneration of both UMNs and LMNs, leading to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and spasticity. A review of the comparative neuroanatomy of the human and zebrafish motor systems showed that, while the zebrafish was a homologous model for LMN disorders, such as SMA, it was only partially relevant in the case of UMN disorders, due to the absence of corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts in its central nervous system. Even considering the limitation of this model to fully reproduce the human UMN disorders, zebrafish offer an excellent alternative vertebrate model for the molecular and genetic dissection of MND mechanisms. Its advantages include the conservation of genome and physiological processes and applicable in vivo tools, including easy imaging, loss or gain of function methods, behavioral tests to examine changes in motor activity, and the ease of simultaneous chemical/drug testing on large numbers of animals. This facilitates the assessment of the environmental origin of MNDs, alone or in combination with genetic traits and putative modifier genes.

Effective treatment of patients with triple-negative (ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-negative) breast cancer remains a challenge. Although PARP inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials, biomarkers are needed to identify patients who will most benefit from anti-PARP therapy. We determined the responses of three PARP inhibitors (veliparib, olaparib, and talazoparib) in a panel of eight triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Therapeutic responses and cellular phenotypes were elucidated using high-content imaging and quantitative immunofluorescence to assess markers of DNA damage (53BP1) and apoptosis (cleaved PARP). We determined the pharmacodynamic changes as percentage of cells positive for 53BP1, mean number of 53BP1 foci per cell, and percentage of cells positive for cleaved PARP. Inspired by traditional dose-response measures of cell viability, an EC50 value was calculated for each cellular phenotype and each PARP inhibitor. The EC50 values for both 53BP1 metrics strongly correlated with IC50 values for each PARP inhibitor. Pathway enrichment analysis identified a set of DNA repair and cell cycle-associated genes that were associated with 53BP1 response following PARP inhibition. The overall accuracy of our 63 gene set in predicting response to olaparib in seven breast cancer patient-derived xenograft tumors was 86%. In triple-negative breast cancer patients who had not received anti-PARP therapy, the predicted response rate of our gene signature was 45%. These results indicate that 53BP1 is a biomarker of response to anti-PARP therapy in the laboratory, and our DNA damage response gene signature may be used to identify patients who are most likely to respond to PARP inhibition.

Cancer has been considered as temporal and spatial aberrations of normal development in tissues. Similarities between mammary embryonic development and cell transformation suggest that the underlying processes required for mammary gland development are also those perturbed during various stages of mammary tumorigenesis and breast cancer (BC) development. The master regulators of embryonic development Cripto-1, Notch/CSL, and Wnt/b-catenin play key roles in modulating mammary gland morphogenesis and cell fate specification in the embryo through fetal mammary stem cells (fMaSC) and in the adult organism particularly within the adult mammary stem cells (aMaSC), which determine mammary progenitor cell lineages that generate the basal/myoepithelial and luminal compartments of the adult mammary gland. Together with recognized transcription factors and embryonic stem cell markers, these embryonic regulatory molecules can be inappropriately augmented during tumorigenesis to support the tumor-initiating cell (TIC)/cancer stem cell (CSC) compartment, and the effects of their deregulation may contribute for the etiology of BC, in particular the most aggressive subtype of BC, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This in depth review will present evidence of the involvement of Cripto-1, Notch/CSL, and Wnt/b-catenin in the normal mammary gland morphogenesis and tumorigenesis, from fMaSC/aMaSC regulation to TIC generation and maintenance in TNBC. Specific therapies for treating TNBC by targeting these embryonic pathways in TICs will be further discussed, providing new opportunities to destroy not only the bulk tumor, but also TICs that initiate and promote the metastatic spread and recurrence of this aggressive subtype of BC.", "sourceid": "26968398", "denotations": [{"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 130, "end": 136}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 128}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 468}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 470, "end": 472}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 1123, "end": 1128}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 1151, "end": 1157}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1260, "end": 1262}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1309, "end": 1311}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1313, "end": 1342}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1344, "end": 1348}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1581, "end": 1585}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1619, "end": 1623}}, {"obj": "Disease:D020323", "span": {"begin": 1665, "end": 1669}}, {"obj": "Disease:D009369", "span": {"begin": 1754, "end": 1759}}, {"obj": "Disease:D020323", "span": {"begin": 1770, "end": 1774}}, {"obj": "Disease:D001943", "span": {"begin": 1868, "end": 1870}}, {"obj": "Species:6239", "span": {"begin": 665, "end": 671}}]}}
